9. Follows on this path with robust growth both in post and salary.
He had come from a traditional, conservative Indian mindset—where roles were rigid and expectations tightly controlled. But after going abroad, his perspective transformed completely. He embraced a more open and progressive outlook: encouraging his wife to work freely without interference, respecting her independence in managing household and social life, and giving her the space to maintain friendships and pursue her own interests. Likewise, he allowed his children to choose their own paths—whether in careers or hobbies—without imposing rigid expectations. He valued their freedom to socialize, explore relationships, and enjoy privacy, fostering an environment of trust and autonomy rather than control.

The couple marries in 1997, blending their progressive values into a supportive family unit, with support and really good relation between the 2 families and within their own respective extended families too. They have their first daughter in 1998, a second daughter in 2002, and a son in 2006.(The 4 kids are the same ones from the original timeline). The son, however, is unique—he is reborn into this world after living a previous life until age 18 in a starkly different reality. In his prior life, his family was lower-class, minimally educated, and ran a small business, bound by a closed-minded, traditional outlook. In contrast, his new family is educated, affluent, and open-minded, offering a nurturing environment that contrasts sharply with his past. By the time the first kid is born they move to a Powai Hiranandani Gardens. And gets admission for all their kids in Hiranandani Foundation School. And then letting their kids to shift to RN Podar for 11th and 12th grade, in which ever field they want.

The above info is the background info for the new world. Now i will share info regarding the previous world.
In the previous world, due to financial issues of Roy, which happened as Roy's brother had sized and illegally had taken his share of wealth and properties leading to all the financial problems, and roy came to Mumbai to get a low paying government job with only high school education, due to this past anon had to drop out of school at the age of 14 and start into the work force in the gold business, which his grandfather had background in, to support his family, and his siblings, his younger brother and sister for their education, specifically his brother who wanted to pursue CA,  due to this he was less educated and more conservative and deep into religious and similar stuff. he succeded to some extent in a fairly good business, but after helping his family and brother, after this brother got a good apying job and got more successful than anon, he left the family with his wife leaving all the burdens alone on anon. he worked hard, but after a few year, his business didn't grow after a limit, and then year by year they passed by. He became more controlling and provided less freedom to his children and wife. Similar thing happened with his wife sophie where she was only educated to 12th grade. and all this culminated to the kids getting subpar education, despite of their immense potential due to not having support, freedom or enough info about the things they want to pursue. the controlling nature led to the kids friends ships getting broken as they weren't allowed to leave the house or hang out with friends. or even try extracurriculam to a greater degree, only limited to studies. the father was of old thought process, manipulative, and abusive, mentally a lot, physically some times. his controlling nature he forced the kids to choose a carrer path in life that he allowed ruining them. In the past Daniel was studing for engineering from a shitty college, both because of his family and his own negligence. like the previous story of Daniel who was a gifted kid the same happened with this Daniel, but all of that was there along with the family problem. his eldest sister was trying in CA exams for over 7 years now, because his father had forced her to, his elder sister had a job now after her college ended, and was sttuding for CS. They were living in a normal 2 bhk flat in Mumbai that anon had bought when his business was well, that was almost 18 year back. the 3 kids slept together, the couple in the 2nd bedroom and the older couple in the living room.

so this the basic background of the past life, about which i will share more as time passes. The story despite being set in india has western names for characters and places. unless its an actual place that i myself have mentioned.	

Daniel is sent back to the age 1 from the age of 18, the reason is unkown, but what he thinks is that it is due to his prayers to god specifically lord krishna to give him a better 2nd chance. 
unlike the previous Daniel story, this time i direct much, most of the heavy lifting will be done by u.

so start with the epilogue chapter first by giving basic info about the past life, his prayers everyday, till him getting sent back, rest u handle the flow or anything u want to add. keep the style similar to the previous Daniel story. ok start.
