Got it! I'll start with the first half of Chapter 1. Here we go:

Chapter 1: The Return of Ai-chan (Part 1)
It was another bright morning in Kasukabe, the kind where the streets smelled of freshly baked bread from the neighborhood bakery, and the distant chatter of students heading to school filled the air. The spring breeze rustled through the cherry blossom trees, sending soft pink petals drifting down onto the streets like confetti.
In the Nohara household, chaos reigned as usual.
"Shinnosuke! If you don’t get out of bed in the next three seconds, you’re skipping breakfast!" Misae’s voice echoed through the house, her usual morning warning in full force.
A muffled groan came from under a heap of blankets. "Mmm… five more minutes, Kaachan…"
"Three… two…—"
Before she could reach zero, a small missile of energy burst into the room.
"Get up, lazy bum!" Hima declared as she pounced onto the lump of blankets.
"Argh! Hima, stop! Your knee is crushing my future!" Shinchan whined, flailing under his younger sister’s attack.
Himawari smirked. "Future? What future? You just laze around all day, Shin-nii."
"I’ll have you know that I’m on my way to becoming an elite gentleman of culture," Shinchan retorted, dramatically sitting up. His signature smirk spread across his face as he ran a hand through his messy black hair. "In high school, the real action begins."
"Right," Misae sighed, watching her son admire himself in the mirror. "If only your grades reflected that energy."
After another round of chaotic breakfast—where Hiroshi barely avoided getting hit by flying toast—Shinchan finally dashed out of the house with his schoolbag, making his way to school.

Kasukabe High School – The Usual Gang
"Yo, Shinchan! You’re late again!" Bo-chan greeted with his usual sleepy drawl as Shinchan walked into the classroom.
"Ahhh, another day of hard work ahead of us," Masao sighed dramatically, adjusting his glasses.
"By hard work, you mean sneaking snacks into class, right?" Nene shot back, crossing her arms.
Shinchan flopped onto his desk, stretching lazily. "What else would I mean? School life is about balance—between fun and naps."
Just as he was about to put his head down, the classroom door slid open. A girl stepped in, her long, silky brown hair swaying slightly with her movement. Her deep blue eyes scanned the room with a quiet confidence. There was something about her—something familiar.
The classroom buzzed with whispers.
"Who’s that?"
 "She’s really pretty!"
 "Wait… isn’t that…?"
Shinchan’s half-asleep eyes blinked in slow realization before widening. His mouth hung open in surprise.
The girl turned toward him and gave a soft smile. "It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Shinnosuke?"

I'll continue with the second half in the next part! Let me know if this is the style you're looking for.

continue, another thing, shinchan is smart both street, emotion and academically, he just doesnt show it as he couldnt care less, like his childhood. 
Chapter 1: A Reunion After Years (Part 1)
The school gates of Kasukabe High stood tall and familiar, yet the air surrounding them felt different today. Spring had just begun, and the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, their petals dancing in the morning breeze. The streets were buzzing with students in their crisp uniforms, chattering about their upcoming school year.
Among them, a tall, lean teenager with a familiar mischievous glint in his eyes strolled lazily towards the entrance. Nohara Shinnosuke, now sixteen, still carried that same carefree grin he had as a child. His jet-black hair was slightly unkempt, and his uniform, while technically correct, had an ever-so-slightly rebellious air to it—the top button undone and his tie loosened just enough to irk the teachers. Despite his laid-back attitude, those who knew him well understood that beneath the surface, Shinchan was far sharper than he let on. His grades were decent when he bothered to try, and his ability to read people and situations often caught others off guard.
“Oi, Shin-chan! Wait up!” a voice called out from behind.
Shinchan turned his head just as Kazama, his childhood best friend, jogged up beside him, adjusting his perfectly tied tie. Despite the years, Kazama still maintained his serious and studious demeanor, though he had grown taller and more refined. His sharp features and neatly combed hair made him look like a model student—a stark contrast to Shinchan.
“Ah, Kazama-kun, you’re still the same old perfectionist, huh?” Shinchan teased, placing an arm around his friend’s shoulder.
Kazama scowled, pushing Shinchan’s arm away. “And you’re still the same troublemaker. Seriously, at least fix your tie! We’re in high school now!”
Shinchan smirked but didn’t bother adjusting it. “Nah, this is part of my charm. Gotta keep the mystery alive.”
Before Kazama could respond, two other figures joined them—Masao, who had developed into a slightly more confident yet still somewhat timid teen, and Bo-chan, who, despite growing taller, still retained his ever-quiet and observant nature. They all exchanged greetings, feeling a sense of nostalgia as they stood together like they always had.
Just as they were about to enter, a sleek black car rolled up near the entrance. The students instinctively turned to look, murmuring among themselves.
Shinchan, ever curious, narrowed his eyes. “Hoooh? Fancy car this early in the morning? Must be some big shot.”
The car door opened, and stepping out was a girl with long, silky brown hair and an elegant posture. She adjusted her schoolbag over her shoulder, her gaze scanning the area with a calm confidence.
Kazama’s eyes widened. “Wait… isn’t that—”
Before he could finish, Shinchan took a step forward, squinting as if trying to place her. And then, like a flash, memories of a tiny girl in a pink dress with an assertive attitude and an almost regal presence came rushing back to him.
“Ai…chan?”
The girl turned, her eyes meeting his. For a moment, silence hung between them as recognition dawned on her face. Then, a soft, knowing smile curled on her lips.
“It’s been a long time, hasn’t it, Shinchan?”
I've incorporated Shinchan's hidden intelligence into the story while keeping his laid-back demeanor. Now, let's continue with Part 2 of Chapter 1!

Chapter 1: A Reunion After Years (Part 2)
The world around them seemed to fade for a brief moment. The murmurs of students, the rustling of cherry blossoms—it all blurred into the background as Shinchan and Ai-chan locked eyes for the first time in years.
Ai-chan took a few steps closer, her gaze steady. There was something undeniably regal about her, just like when they were kids, but now she carried herself with even more poise.
Shinchan, on the other hand, tilted his head, his trademark smirk creeping onto his lips. “Oho, long time no see, Ai-chan. I see you’ve returned, richer and fancier than ever.”
A flicker of amusement crossed her face. “And you’re still as cheeky as I remember.”
Kazama, standing beside them, finally snapped out of his stunned silence. “Wait, wait, wait—Ai-chan?! As in Koyama Ai? The one who moved away after kindergarten?”
Ai-chan nodded gracefully. “Yes. My family had to relocate for business, but now we’re back in Kasukabe for good.”
Masao’s jaw nearly hit the floor. “That’s insane! We used to play together all the time, and now you’re suddenly back?!”
Nene crossed her arms, studying Ai-chan with a mix of curiosity and admiration. “Wow, you really look like a celebrity now. Are you sure you’re still the same Ai-chan?”
Ai-chan chuckled. “Of course. Though, I admit, a lot has changed.” Her gaze returned to Shinchan. “Including all of you.”
Shinchan folded his arms behind his head. “Nah, I’m still the same charming, handsome, highly sought-after man of culture.”
Kazama sighed. “You’re an idiot.”
Ai-chan raised an eyebrow, a small smirk forming. “Oh? Highly sought-after, you say? I wonder if your reputation still precedes you.”
Shinchan shrugged, grinning. “You’ll find out soon enough, Ai-chan.”
Just then, the school bell rang, snapping everyone back to reality.
Kazama grabbed Shinchan’s arm, already exasperated. “Come on, we’re going to be late!”
As they all started heading inside, Ai-chan matched Shinchan’s pace, walking beside him. “It really is good to see you again, Shinchan.”
For a moment, something flickered in Shinchan’s usually carefree expression—something genuine. Then, with a smirk, he replied, “Same here, Ai-chan. This year just got a lot more interesting.”

And that wraps up Chapter 1! The stage is set for Ai-chan’s return and the fun dynamics to come. Let me know what you think, and I’ll get started on Chapter 2!

Here’s the first half of Chapter 2, where Ai-chan continues trying to get Shinchan’s attention, but he remains oblivious (or just doesn’t care). Let me know if you’d like any changes or if I should continue with Part 2!
You said:
ok so there is also an arc of shinchan going back in to kendo in this story. each chapter should have some conclusion like the pryramid patteren with a set up plot, climax and conclusion, or progression in the story. something like kaguya sama, most of the episodes in a way a self contained but there are clear progession. also keep the progression of normal shinchan too where he woke up went to school did things and retrned home, till some extent. and not just shinchan all 6 of them have things or arc following them. make it comedic following the humour as normal shinchan. and answer in the chat.

Got it! I’ll structure each chapter with a proper setup, climax, and resolution while keeping things comedic and progressing the overall arcs. Shinchan’s daily routine, as well as arcs for the whole gang, will be included. The humor will stay true to classic Shinchan while blending with a rom-com, slice-of-life high school setting.
For now, I’ll continue with Chapter 2, Part 2, making sure it has a satisfying conclusion. Stay tuned!

shinchan is good at it but, there is more of an emotional turmoil than anything. you can also intro new characters in the high school.

Got it! Shinchan will be naturally talented at Kendo, but his journey will involve emotional struggles rather than just proving his skills. I’ll introduce new characters to expand the high school setting and create more dynamics.
For the next chapter, I’ll set up Shinchan’s return to Kendo with some internal conflict—maybe an old rival, a strict coach, or even some past baggage from why he quit in the first place. Meanwhile, Ai-chan keeps scheming to get closer to him, and the rest of the gang gets involved in their own way.
Should I continue with Chapter 3: The Kendo Duel! The Lazy Genius Awakens?!

Alright! I’ll make Shinchan’s past with Kendo a key emotional point—maybe he quit because of a personal loss, an unresolved rivalry, or a deeper reason tied to his carefree attitude. His return won’t just be about skill but about facing something from his past.
I'll continue with Chapter 3, where his first steps back into the Kendo Club will stir up old emotions, and Ai-chan, along with the others, will witness a side of Shinchan they don’t usually see. Stay tuned!

Chapter 3: The Kendo Duel! The Lazy Genius Awakens?!

Setup: A Ghost from the Past
The Kendo Club’s dojo was buzzing with activity. Upperclassmen sparred with precision, the sound of bamboo swords clashing echoing through the wooden hall. The air smelled of sweat and tradition.
Shinchan stood at the entrance, arms lazily draped over his wooden shinai. His eyes scanned the room, unimpressed.
“Hmmm… this place is pretty lively,” he muttered. “Almost makes me wanna nap.”
Kazama groaned. “If you’re going to slack off, why did you even join?”
Ai-chan stood beside Shinchan, watching him closely. She had noticed something different about him the moment they stepped inside. His usual carefree energy seemed… off. It wasn’t nervousness, but something deeper.
Before she could ask, a voice called out.
“Shinnosuke Nohara…”
Shinchan’s expression froze for half a second—so brief that most people wouldn’t have caught it. But Ai-chan did.
A tall, third-year student stepped forward, removing his helmet. His sharp eyes locked onto Shinchan. “I never thought I’d see you back here.”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Wait… who’s this?”
The senior tightened his grip on his shinai. “Hiroto Sakagami. Captain of the Kendo Club.”
Masao gulped. “H-He looks scary…”
Nene tilted her head. “Does Shinchan know him?”
Bo-chan nodded slowly. “There’s history.”
Hiroto crossed his arms. “You disappeared from the dojo years ago. No explanation. No farewell. Just quit out of nowhere.”
The atmosphere tensed. Ai-chan’s eyes darted between them. So this is what I was sensing…
Shinchan scratched his head, pretending to yawn. “Ehhh? I don’t even remember quitting. One day I was here, the next day I wasn’t. That’s life, right?”
Hiroto’s grip on his shinai tightened. “Don’t joke around. Do you have any idea what you left behind?”

Climax: A Duel of Unfinished Business
Silence stretched between them. Then, Hiroto pointed his shinai at Shinchan. “Let’s see if you still have it. One match. Right now.”
Kazama frowned. “Shinchan, you don’t have to—”
Shinchan stepped forward. “Nah, it’s fine.”
Ai-chan’s eyes widened. He accepted that too fast.
A few minutes later, Shinchan was suited up, standing across from Hiroto. The other club members gathered around, murmuring among themselves.
“He was supposed to be a genius back then, right?”
“Yeah, but that was years ago. He probably lost his edge.”
Hiroto took his stance. “Come at me seriously, or don’t come at all.”
Shinchan sighed, lowering into position. I didn’t come here to fight old ghosts, but… His grip firmed on his shinai. Guess I’ve got no choice.
The moment the signal was given, Hiroto lunged.
The bamboo swords clashed with a crack.
Everyone watching held their breath.

Conclusion: A Glimpse of the Past
Despite his lazy attitude, Shinchan moved with natural precision. His reflexes were sharp, his footwork light. He dodged, countered, and struck with effortless flow, as if his body never forgot.
Hiroto gritted his teeth. He’s barely trying… and he’s still keeping up?!
Ai-chan, watching from the sidelines, felt her heart race. This wasn’t the usual Shinchan. There was something hidden beneath his usual indifference—something he was holding back.
Then, just as quickly as it began, Shinchan stepped back.
“Alright, that’s enough,” he said, lowering his shinai. “I’m done.”
Hiroto’s eyes widened. “What?!”
Shinchan removed his helmet, grinning. “See? I still got it. No need to drag out old drama.”
He turned to leave, but Hiroto called out. “Why did you really quit back then?”
Shinchan paused. His expression unreadable. Then, without turning around, he waved lazily. “Maybe I’ll tell you someday.”
Ai-chan watched him go, a mix of curiosity and concern swirling in her chest. This isn’t over yet…

To be continued in Chapter 4: A New Rival, A New Problem! Ai-chan’s Strategy Continues!
I've continued with Chapter 3, introducing Hiroto Sakagami, the Kendo Club Captain, as a figure from Shinchan’s past. His return to Kendo stirs up old emotions, and Ai-chan starts noticing the hidden side of him. Let me know if you want any tweaks or if I should continue with Chapter 4!

You said:
ok for now continue with this kendo things, but we dont reach its conclusion now, there is still a long way to it. but also focus on other things. this story should be a mixture of horimiya, kaguya sama and shinchan. also make sure the chapter are 4000-6000 words long. if you cant fit it in a single responce split it.

Got it! The Kendo arc will continue developing without a quick resolution, and I'll keep focusing on other aspects of high school life—comedy, romance, and slice-of-life moments—while maintaining the mix of Horimiya, Kaguya-sama, and Shinchan humor.
I'll continue Chapter 4, keeping it within the 4000-6000 word range. Since that’s long, I’ll split it into multiple responses. Here comes the next part!
Chapter 4: A New Rival, A New Problem! Ai-chan’s Strategy Continues!
The echoes of the duel still lingered in Ai-chan’s mind as she sat with the others in the cafeteria. Shinchan, as usual, was stuffing his face with yakisoba bread, entirely unbothered by the events of the day. Kazama, on the other hand, was still fuming.
“I don’t get you at all, Shinchan!” he snapped, slamming his juice box onto the table. “You were clearly the better fighter! Why did you just stop?”
Shinchan swallowed his food and stretched lazily. “I got bored.”
Kazama twitched. “You ‘got bored’ in the middle of a serious match?!”
Ai-chan narrowed her eyes. She knew Shinchan was hiding something. There was a weight behind his decision, something he refused to acknowledge even to himself. That duel wasn’t just about skill—it was about his past. And she wasn’t about to let it slide.
“So,” Ai-chan said, leaning forward with a coy smile. “Since you’re back in Kendo now, does that mean you’ll be practicing every day?”
Shinchan blinked at her. “Huh? Who said anything about practicing?”
“The fact that you joined the club?”
“Details, details.” He waved a hand dismissively. “It’s more like I’m a special guest. I’ll show up when I feel like it.”
Kazama groaned into his hands. “You can’t just half-commit to things like this!”
Before Ai-chan could press further, an unfamiliar voice interrupted them.
“Shinnosuke Nohara, huh? So you’re the famous prodigy.”
They turned to see a tall girl with sharp, amber eyes standing over their table. She wore the school’s sports jacket over her uniform and carried herself with an air of confidence.
“You are?” Shinchan asked, looking up from his food.
“Rika Miyamoto,” she said with a smirk. “Vice-captain of the Kendo Club. And your new rival.”
The group stared at her. Even Bo-chan, who usually remained silent, blinked in mild surprise.
Shinchan scratched his head. “Ehhh? But we just met.”
“You think that matters?” Rika crossed her arms. “I saw your match earlier. You’re holding back. And I don’t respect people who don’t take their craft seriously.”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Well, you’re not wrong there…”
Ai-chan, however, sensed an opportunity. If this girl could push Shinchan into taking Kendo seriously, she might be useful.
She smiled sweetly. “Shinchan, are you really going to let her talk to you like that?”
Shinchan, mid-chew, gave her a side glance. “I dunno, I think she’s got a point.”
Rika’s eye twitched. “You—do you even have any fighting spirit?!”
Shinchan finished his bread, sighed, and stood up. “Alright, alright. If it’ll make you feel better, I’ll spar with you. But only if I get another yakisoba bread afterward.”
Rika’s smirk widened. “Deal.”
Ai-chan watched the exchange with a knowing smile. This wasn’t just about Kendo anymore. The pieces were moving, and she was going to make sure Shinchan didn’t slip away so easily.
As Shinchan stretched and prepared for another match, Ai-chan folded her arms. “This is getting interesting.”

The dojo was emptier than before, only a few club members lingering to watch the unexpected match. Kazama, Nene, Masao, Bo-chan, and Ai-chan sat on the sidelines, watching closely. Rika, now in full Kendo gear, took her stance, eyes locked onto Shinchan.
Shinchan yawned. “You sure you wanna do this? I’m kinda full. Might move a little slow.”
Rika scowled. “Tch. Don’t underestimate me just because I’m a girl.”
“Eh? I wasn’t thinking that at all. I was just making excuses in case I lose,” Shinchan said bluntly, stretching his arms.
Kazama facepalmed. “Can you at least pretend to take this seriously?!”
The instructor clapped his hands. “Begin!”
Rika moved first, dashing forward with a sharp, controlled strike. Shinchan didn’t dodge, but instead tilted his head just slightly, letting the attack graze past him. With minimal movement, he repositioned, knocking her shinai off-course with a light tap.
Ai-chan watched, intrigued. He’s so efficient… no wasted movement.
Rika gritted her teeth and attacked again—faster, sharper. But every time, Shinchan simply wasn’t there when the strike landed. He’d already shifted just enough to avoid it, like a ghost slipping through gaps.
The onlookers murmured.
“He’s not even fighting back…”
“Is he toying with her?”
Rika stepped back, adjusting her stance. He’s just reading me… She narrowed her eyes. Fine. Let’s see how you handle this!
She feinted left, forcing Shinchan to lean slightly. Then, without warning, she twisted mid-movement and brought her shinai down in a fast overhead strike.
Ai-chan gasped. That’s going to hit!
And then, in the blink of an eye—
Shinchan stopped it.
With just one hand.
A perfectly timed, almost lazy counter—his shinai angled just right to intercept, stopping her swing completely.
Silence.
Rika’s eyes widened in shock. She couldn’t move. Her blade was completely locked down.
Shinchan sighed. “You’re good, but you’re thinking too much.”
He stepped back, lowering his weapon. “Alright, I think that’s enough. I get it, you’re strong.”
Rika’s grip tightened. “You… you’re not even trying!”
Shinchan gave her a lazy smile. “Maybe. But that doesn’t mean I don’t respect your skill.”
Rika’s face burned. Not from embarrassment—from frustration. This guy was an enigma. Holding back, avoiding real fights, refusing to take it seriously…
She clenched her fists. I’ll make you fight me seriously. Just wait.
The match was over, but Ai-chan knew this wasn’t the end of the story. Far from it.
As they left the dojo, she walked beside Shinchan. “So? What do you think of her?”
Shinchan stretched, yawning. “She’s alright.”
Ai-chan smirked. Interesting…
Chapter 5: A Challenge Beyond Kendo – Ai-chan’s Next Move!
The match against Rika had stirred something in the school. Word spread like wildfire that Shinnosuke Nohara, the supposed lazy goofball, was actually a Kendo prodigy. Rumors swirled that he was unbeatable, that he was secretly training in the mountains, or that he had been a national champion in middle school. The truth? He simply didn’t care enough to correct anyone.
“Oi, Shinchan, people are saying you’re a wandering Kendo master who fights challengers in the dead of night,” Masao said, reading a school forum on his phone.
“Nice,” Shinchan replied, barely paying attention as he picked at his bento.
Kazama groaned. “This isn’t good! You’re attracting too much attention. And you know what happens when someone gets famous in school?”
“They get free snacks?”
“They get challenged!”
Just as Kazama finished his sentence, a loud voice boomed from the cafeteria entrance. “NOHARA! I CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL!”
The entire cafeteria turned to see a muscular third-year student, Kendo gear slung over his shoulder, standing with dramatic flair. Behind him, a crowd of excited students murmured.
“Oh no,” Kazama muttered.
Ai-chan, however, smirked. “Oh yes.”
Shinchan slowly turned to the challenger, blinking lazily. “Uh… and you are?”
“Hajime Okabe! Vice-president of the Kendo Club! You embarrassed our vice-captain, and I demand retribution!”
Rika, standing behind Okabe, facepalmed. “I told you not to do this, you idiot.”
Shinchan let out a long sigh. “Man… I just wanna eat.”
Ai-chan leaned forward with a teasing smile. “Shinchan, if you win, I’ll make you a special bento tomorrow~”
Kazama gasped. “She’s bribing him with food!”
Masao trembled. “It’s… it’s over.”
Shinchan’s ears perked up. “You’ll put in those extra spicy karaage wings I like?”
Ai-chan giggled. “Maaaybe~”
Shinchan stood up, stretching. “Alright, fine. But let’s make it quick. I have a nap scheduled after this.”
Rika groaned. “This idiot…”

The Kendo hall filled with students eager to witness another legendary duel. Shinchan stood across from Okabe, still looking half-asleep. Okabe, on the other hand, was buzzing with energy, gripping his shinai like a warrior ready for battle.
“Ready yourself, Nohara!” Okabe roared.
Shinchan yawned. “Yeah, yeah.”
The match began. Okabe lunged with impressive speed, swinging for a decisive blow. But—
Whoosh!
His strike cut through empty air.
Shinchan was already behind him, tapping him lightly on the shoulder. “Yo.”
Okabe spun around in shock. “What—?!”
Shinchan’s movements were effortless, dodging each of Okabe’s attacks like a gentle breeze shifting out of the way. The crowd gasped in awe, and even Ai-chan watched intently.
He’s not just good. He’s incredible.
After a few more missed strikes, Okabe stumbled back, panting. “Why won’t you fight seriously?!”
Shinchan scratched his head. “Because you’re thinking too much. Just relax.”
Ai-chan’s eyes sparkled. He’s not just dodging… he’s reading their movements before they even act. How much talent is this idiot hiding?!
With one final swift movement, Shinchan tapped Okabe’s shinai out of his hands, sending it clattering to the floor.
Silence. Then—
Cheers erupted.
Ai-chan crossed her arms. This is just the beginning. I won’t let you run away from your talent, Shinchan.
As they left the dojo, Shinchan stretched. “Okay, bento time.”
Ai-chan smirked. Oh no, my dear Shinchan. This is just the start of your training arc…
Chapter 6: Chaos at the Nohara Household – A New Day Begins!
The early morning sun peeked through the curtains of the Nohara household, casting a warm glow over the living room. The peaceful silence was shattered by the sound of rapid footsteps and an unmistakable shriek.
“SHIN-CHAN! WAKE UP, YOU’RE GONNA BE LATE!”
Misae’s voice echoed through the house as she banged on her son’s bedroom door. Inside, Shinchan lay sprawled across his bed, one leg hanging off the side, drooling onto his pillow. He grumbled something unintelligible and turned over, pulling the blanket over his head.
“Shinnosuke! I swear, if you don’t get up in three seconds—”
“Five more minutes, kaachan,” he mumbled.
“ONE!”
THWACK!
A slipper flew straight into his forehead, causing him to jolt upright in bed. “I’M AWAKE, I’M AWAKE!”
Downstairs, Hiroshi sat at the table, leisurely reading the newspaper while munching on toast. “You’re really going all out this morning, dear.”
“I have to! This boy is going to be late at this rate!” Misae huffed, returning to the kitchen.
Himawari sat across from Hiroshi, sipping a juice box with a smirk. “You always fall for it, Onii-chan.”
Shinchan trudged down the stairs, still half-asleep. He slumped into his chair and took a bite of his toast, eyes barely open. “Mornin’.”
“Eat faster and get dressed, or I’ll throw you out in your pajamas,” Misae warned.
He waved a hand lazily. “It’s all good, school isn’t going anywhere.”
Himawari sighed. “Onii-chan, you’re hopeless.”
Hiroshi chuckled. “He gets it from your mom.”
THWACK! A slipper hit Hiroshi next.
“Say something else and your dinner is plain rice,” Misae snapped.

By the time Shinchan finally left for school, he was barely on time. The walk to school was routine, but as he turned the corner, he noticed Ai-chan waiting for him at the usual spot.
“Oh? You’re awake this early?” Ai-chan teased.
Shinchan yawned. “My mom’s slipper woke me up.”
Ai-chan laughed. “That sounds about right.”
The two walked together, chatting casually about school and the usual gossip. Ai-chan was scheming as always, but Shinchan remained oblivious, focusing more on whether the cafeteria would have his favorite yakisoba bread again.
As they arrived at the school gates, a new face greeted them—a transfer student nervously adjusting his glasses.
“Excuse me… is this Year 2, Class B?” he asked politely.
Ai-chan nodded. “It is. Are you new?”
The boy nodded. “Yes, I just moved here. I’m Rento Fujikawa.”
Shinchan blinked. “You like snacks?”
Rento hesitated. “Uh… I guess?”
Shinchan grinned. “Alright, you pass. Welcome to the squad.”
Ai-chan sighed. This guy…

As the day progressed, Shinchan and his friends went through the usual high school antics. In class, Kazama tried (and failed) to keep Shinchan from spacing out. During lunch, Nene dragged Masao into another ridiculous scheme to earn money, which somehow ended with them being chased by the cafeteria lady. Bo-chan, as always, watched quietly with his mysterious wisdom.
Meanwhile, Ai-chan had other plans brewing. She watched Shinchan interact with the new transfer student and thought, Maybe a bit of jealousy would push him in the right direction.
That afternoon, she invited Rento to walk home with them. Shinchan, as usual, was more focused on snacks than on social dynamics, but Kazama immediately noticed Ai-chan’s subtle attempts to get closer to the new guy.
“You’re playing with fire,” Kazama muttered as they walked.
Ai-chan smirked. “Oh? Whatever do you mean?”
Shinchan, completely missing the underlying tension, looked at Rento. “By the way, do you prefer melon bread or cream puffs?”
Rento blinked. “Uh… melon bread?”
Shinchan nodded seriously. “Good choice. You’ll survive.”
Kazama groaned. He really doesn’t get it…
Chapter 7: A Day of Unexpected Plans
The school bell rang, signaling the end of another exhausting day. Shinchan stretched his arms above his head, letting out a loud yawn as he lazily slumped against his desk.
"Finally over! Time to head home and—"
Before he could even complete his sentence, Ai-chan slammed her hands on his desk, looking smug. "Not so fast, Shin-chan! We’re going out today."
He blinked. "Huh? Since when?"
"Since I decided," Ai-chan replied, flicking her hair. "You, me, and the rest of the gang. We need to do something fun outside of school, don’t you think?"
Kazama, who had been listening in, adjusted his glasses. "I suppose it’s good to change the environment once in a while, but where exactly are we going?"
"That," Ai-chan said with a grin, "is a surprise."
Masao gulped. "S-Surprises never end well for me."
Bo-chan, ever the mysterious one, simply nodded. "Hm."

Thirty minutes later, they found themselves standing outside a large shopping mall in the city. The bustling crowd and bright store signs created a lively atmosphere.
Shinchan, hands in his pockets, looked around. "So, what now?"
Ai-chan crossed her arms. "Simple. We split into teams and explore!" She quickly grabbed Rento’s arm. "Rento-kun, you’re with me!"
Kazama’s eyebrow twitched. "Wait, why are you pairing up already? Shouldn’t we decide fairly?"
Ai-chan smiled innocently. "Oh, I just thought it’d be nice to help our new friend adjust."
Kazama sighed. "We all know what you're doing."
Shinchan, meanwhile, was more focused on a food stall nearby. "Ooh, taiyaki!"
Ai-chan huffed. "You’re seriously thinking about food right now?"
"Of course," he replied. "Shopping’s only fun if there’s good food."
Masao clutched his wallet nervously. "I don’t have much money..."
Nene patted his back. "Don’t worry, Masao-kun. You can always take out a loan from me! With reasonable interest, of course."
Kazama groaned. "Nene, you are not a loan shark."
Bo-chan, staring at a clothing store window, simply said, "Hoodie."
And so, the group split up, each going on their own little adventures in the mall. Ai-chan, determined to make Shinchan feel something, exaggerated her excitement with Rento. Kazama, wary of Ai-chan’s tactics, kept a close eye on the situation. Masao, unfortunately, got dragged into a shopping spree with Nene. Bo-chan? He bought a single hoodie and then sat on a bench, observing everything like an ancient sage.
Kazama, growing tired of Ai-chan’s games, decided to intervene. He walked up to Shinchan, who was eating yet another snack. "You’re really not paying any attention, are you?"
Shinchan blinked mid-bite. "To what?"
Kazama sighed. "Never mind. Anyway, how about checking out the arcade instead? We haven’t been there in a while."
"Ooh, now you’re talking!" Shinchan’s eyes gleamed with excitement. "Let’s go, then!"
Rento, who had been caught in Ai-chan’s schemes, let out a relieved sigh. "Arcade sounds fun."
The entire group reconvened at the arcade, where the real chaos began. Kazama, despite his composed nature, got fiercely competitive in a strategy game against Ai-chan. Nene, as expected, tried to turn the claw machines into a money-making scheme, much to Masao’s despair. Shinchan and Bo-chan went straight to the classic fighting games, attracting a small crowd as Shinchan, for once, displayed his hidden skill. Even Ai-chan took notice.
He’s actually good at this... she thought, but before she could dwell on it further, Kazama defeated her in their match, smirking victoriously.
The arcade trip stretched into the evening, with everyone enjoying themselves. When they finally left, the atmosphere felt lighter. Even Ai-chan, despite her failed attempt at making Shinchan jealous, had to admit she had fun.
As they all started heading home, Ai-chan walked beside Shinchan, pouting slightly. "Hey, Shin-chan... did you at least enjoy spending time with me?"
Shinchan glanced at her and gave a lazy smile. "Yeah, it was fun. But next time, let’s go somewhere with more snacks."
Ai-chan clenched her fists. This guy...!
Meanwhile, Kazama, watching the entire exchange, shook his head. "This is going to take a while..."
Chapter 8 expands the setting beyond school, focusing on Shinchan's home life and introducing more family interactions while keeping the humor intact. Let me know if you want any tweaks or if I should continue with Chapter 9!

Got it! I'll keep these elements in mind for future chapters. Now, let's continue with Chapter 9.

Chapter 9: Boys’ Night Out and a Minor Crisis
The weekend had finally arrived, and for once, there was no school, no Ai-chan ambushing him, and no family chaos—yet. Shinchan sighed in relief as he lazed around in his room, sprawled out on the floor, flipping through a manga.
"Ahh, peace. Pure, uninterrupted—"
Ding dong!
The doorbell rang. Shinchan groaned. "Of course."
Misae's voice followed. "Shin-chan! Your friends are here!"
Reluctantly, Shinchan dragged himself up and shuffled to the front door. Standing outside were Kazama, Masao, and Bo-chan.
Kazama adjusted his glasses with an air of importance. "Shinchan, we're going out. Get dressed."
"Eh? Go where?" Shinchan asked, scratching his stomach.
"Doesn't matter! We just need to hang out like old times," Masao chimed in excitedly.
Bo-chan nodded sagely. "The bond of men is important."
Shinchan blinked. "Is this some kind of weird cult meeting?"
Kazama sighed. "Just put on something decent and come on. We're going."
Five minutes later, Shinchan emerged in his usual casual wear and sunglasses. "Alright, let’s go, my loyal minions."
Kazama facepalmed. "I already regret this."

Boys' Night Out: A Disaster Waiting to Happen
The four of them strolled into the shopping district, looking for something to do.
"Arcade?" Masao suggested.
"Too predictable," Kazama dismissed.
"Ramen?" Bo-chan offered.
Shinchan’s eyes lit up. "Now you’re speaking my language!"
Kazama groaned. "We always eat! Let’s do something productive for once!"
"Like what? Taxes?" Shinchan snorted.
Kazama glared. "I was thinking of maybe checking out some books—"
Shinchan, Masao, and Bo-chan immediately turned away in disinterest.
"Fine! We’ll get ramen!" Kazama huffed.
A short while later, they were slurping down bowls of steaming miso ramen in a small, cozy shop. The warmth of the broth combined with the nostalgic feeling of hanging out together made it feel like the old days.
"This is nice," Masao said, smiling. "It feels like kindergarten again, just… with less accidental nudity."
"Speak for yourself," Shinchan muttered.
Kazama choked on his noodles. "Excuse me?!"
"Joking, joking," Shinchan waved lazily.
As they ate, a group of older students from another school entered the shop. They were loud, obnoxious, and very clearly looking for trouble.
Shinchan noticed them immediately but continued eating. "Here we go…"
"Ugh, I hate guys like these," Kazama muttered under his breath.
Unfortunately, one of the delinquents accidentally bumped into Masao on the way to his seat.
"Oi, watch it," the guy growled.
Masao paled. "Ah! Sorry, sorry!"
Shinchan sighed and wiped his mouth before standing up. "Oi, you got a problem?"
The guy turned to him, sneering. "Huh? You trying to start something, punk?"
Shinchan tilted his head. "Not really. But you're ruining my digestion, and that’s a crime against my stomach."
The other delinquents snickered, but their leader seemed irritated. "You got guts, brat. You wanna fight?"
Kazama and Masao immediately panicked. "No, no, he doesn't!" Kazama cut in. "He's just an idiot! Please ignore him!"
Bo-chan, as calm as ever, simply continued eating.
The delinquent, however, didn’t seem satisfied. He reached forward, grabbing Shinchan by the collar. "Listen here, you—"
Before he could finish, Shinchan effortlessly twisted his arm, forcing him to let go.
The guy yelped. "What the hell?!"
Shinchan shrugged. "Oh, sorry. Reflexes."
The other delinquents froze. The leader hesitated for a second, then clicked his tongue. "Tch. Whatever. You losers aren’t worth the trouble."
They walked away, muttering to themselves.
Masao collapsed in relief. "Oh my god, I thought we were dead!"
Kazama shot Shinchan a look. "What the hell was that?!"
Shinchan casually resumed eating. "What? I handled it."
Kazama groaned. "You can FIGHT?!"
Shinchan smirked. "Didn’t I mention? I’m a man of many talents."
Bo-chan nodded. "That was smooth."
Kazama just shook his head. "Unbelievable…"
Masao, still trembling, whispered, "Let's never do this again."

After finishing their ramen, the four friends wandered the town for a while, visiting their old childhood spots. They ended up at the playground where they used to play as kids.
Shinchan sat on the swings, staring at the sky. "Man… time flies, huh?"
Masao nodded. "Feels weird, being in high school now."
Kazama sighed. "Yeah. Back then, our biggest problems were naps and snack time."
Bo-chan added, "Now it’s exams and romance problems."
Masao winced. "Ugh, don’t remind me."
Shinchan smirked. "Kazama, how’s your love life?"
Kazama turned red. "I—wha—why are you asking me?!"
"Cause you're the responsible one. Shouldn’t you have some perfect, high-achieving girlfriend by now?"
Kazama groaned. "I hate you so much."
Masao sighed dramatically. "Man, I wish a cute girl would confess to me…"
Bo-chan suddenly pointed. "Masao, a dog is peeing on your shoe."
Masao screamed.
The others burst out laughing.
Just like old times.

Meanwhile…
Back at home, Misae sat on the couch, scrolling through old photo albums. Hiroshi peeked over her shoulder.
"Feeling nostalgic?" he asked.
Misae smiled. "Just a little. Look at them, Hiroshi. They’ve grown up so much."
Hiroshi chuckled. "Yeah… but Shinchan is still the same troublemaker."
Misae sighed. "And I wouldn’t have it any other way."

The night ended with Shinchan returning home, exhausted but satisfied.
As he collapsed onto his bed, he smirked.
"Man… life’s kinda fun, huh?"
And with that, he drifted off to sleep, completely unaware of the chaos that awaited him tomorrow.

End of Chapter 9
This chapter expanded on Shinchan's friendships and included a classic slice-of-life boys’ night out. Let me know what you think and if you want any adjustments before moving on to Chapter 10!

Chapter 10: A Study Session That Goes Horribly Wrong
Shinchan was enjoying his morning in the only way he knew how—by doing absolutely nothing productive. He lay sprawled on the floor, idly tossing a ball against the ceiling, humming to himself.
Unfortunately, peace never lasted long in the Nohara household.
"Shin-chan!" Misae’s voice rang through the house.
"Ugh, what now…"
Before he could react, Misae stormed into his room, hands on her hips. "Kazama-kun called. You forgot about the study session today, didn’t you?"
Shinchan blinked. "Study session?"
"YES. The one for the upcoming tests! Everyone's already at the café waiting for you!"
Shinchan sighed dramatically. "Tests? Pfft. I don't fear such mortal concepts."
Misae cracked her knuckles. "If you don’t leave in five minutes, you’ll fear ME."
With the wisdom of a man who valued his life, Shinchan was out the door in two minutes.

At the Café: The Disaster Begins
The study session was held at a small café near their school, one of those trendy places with overpriced coffee and tiny desserts. When Shinchan arrived, his friends were already seated, their books open.
Kazama tapped his watch. "You're late."
Shinchan plopped into a seat. "Fashionably."
Ai-chan, who had been quietly sipping her tea, perked up. "Shin-chan~ You came!"
Shinchan nodded. "Yeah, yeah. So, who’s failing what?"
Masao groaned. "Math. As always."
Kazama sighed. "Shinchan, you're surprisingly good at math. Help Masao."
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "What’s in it for me?"
Kazama crossed his arms. "Not failing high school."
"...Touche."
Bo-chan suddenly spoke. "I brought snacks."
Everyone turned to see a small mountain of sweets and pastries on the table.
Shinchan’s eyes sparkled. "Bo-chan, you’re an angel."
Kazama groaned. "Can we PLEASE focus?"
Nene smirked. "Agreed. If you all fail, I’ll have to suffer in the remedial classes with you, and that’s NOT happening."
Ai-chan leaned in. "Don’t worry, Nene-chan. If you fail, I can always get my father to hire private tutors for everyone!"
Kazama paled. "I’d rather study, thanks."
And so, the session began.

The Struggle of Studying
"Masao, what's the answer to question three?" Kazama asked.
Masao nervously looked at his paper. "Uh… is it 37?"
Kazama sighed. "No. It’s negative two."
Masao groaned. "I hate math."
Shinchan leaned over. "Here, look. Just break it down like this—"
To everyone’s surprise, Shinchan actually explained it in a way that made sense.
Masao’s jaw dropped. "Oh… OH! I GET IT!"
Kazama blinked. "Wait… Shinchan, why are you actually good at this?"
Shinchan shrugged. "What can I say? My genius is merely hidden beneath my desire to slack off."
Kazama rubbed his temples. "That makes it worse."
Meanwhile, Ai-chan had abandoned studying entirely. Instead, she was watching Shinchan, resting her chin in her hands, smiling dreamily.
Nene nudged her. "You’re staring."
Ai-chan sighed. "He’s so effortlessly cool."
Nene raised an eyebrow. "He just helped Masao with algebra."
"Exactly. A smart, delinquent-ish type who’s secretly capable? It’s attractive!"
Nene gave her a look. "You have a weird taste in men."
"More like refined taste," Ai-chan corrected.
Kazama, overhearing, looked utterly betrayed. "Refined?! He doesn’t even bring a pencil to class half the time!"
Shinchan yawned. "Why bring one when I can borrow yours?"
Kazama looked like he wanted to strangle him.

The Chaos Escalates
Just as things seemed to be settling down, disaster struck.
Bo-chan, who had been eating his way through the snacks, calmly stated, "Nene, your bag is smoking."
Everyone turned.
Sure enough, there was a small wisp of smoke rising from Nene’s bag.
Nene’s eyes widened. "WHAT?!"
Panicked, she yanked the bag open—and a small explosion of glitter burst out.
The entire café went silent.
Shinchan blinked. "...Are we under attack?"
Kazama coughed, wiping glitter off his glasses. "What just happened?"
Nene turned red. "I—I forgot I had a craft project in there!"
Ai-chan giggled. "Now this study session is truly fabulous."
The café owner stormed over. "WHAT IS GOING ON?!"
Kazama immediately stood up. "We are VERY SORRY. This was an accident!"
Shinchan nudged Masao. "Run?"
Masao nodded. "Run."
Before anyone could react, Shinchan and Masao bolted out the door, leaving the others to deal with the fallout.

Aftermath
Later that evening, back at Shinchan’s house, the group reconvened in his room, Kazama still fuming.
"You LEFT US."
Shinchan, lounging on his bed, waved dismissively. "Survival of the fittest, my friend."
Nene sighed. "At least the café owner let us clean up instead of banning us forever."
Masao shuddered. "I still have glitter in my ears…"
Bo-chan, unbothered, took out another snack. "It was fun."
Kazama groaned. "We got nothing done!"
Ai-chan, still covered in a faint shimmer of glitter, smiled. "I think we made some great memories, though."
Kazama threw his hands up. "Memories don’t pass exams!"
Shinchan smirked. "Well, neither do you, apparently."
Kazama lunged at him. "I SWEAR TO—"
As the room descended into chaos once again, Misae poked her head in.
"Shin-chan, keep it down! And stop causing trouble for your friends!"
Shinchan grinned. "But trouble is my middle name!"
Kazama muttered, "That explains so much."
And so, another completely unproductive but memorable day came to an end.

End of Chapter 10

Chapter 12: The Great Ai-chan Operation
It was a calm afternoon at school. The sun was shining, birds were chirping, and Shinchan was blissfully napping on the classroom desk while Kazama was furiously flipping through his notes.
"Shinchan, wake up! Class is about to start!" Kazama scolded.
Shinchan lazily opened one eye. "Kazama, my dear friend… did you know that in some cultures, a midday nap is considered a sacred tradition?"
Kazama rolled his eyes. "Yeah? Well, in our culture, failing exams leads to remedial classes."
Shinchan groaned, stretching out. "Fine, fine. I’m up."
But unknown to him, a certain someone was preparing a carefully planned mission—a mission to make the ever-unbothered Shinchan react.

Operation: "Make Shin-chan Blush!"
Ai-chan sat at her desk, watching Shinchan with a sly smile.
So far, none of my cute, romantic moves have gotten through to him… but today… today will be different!
She had spent all night researching techniques from romance manga, dating advice blogs, and even some questionable "How to Make Your Crush Notice You!" articles. Today, she was going all in.
Shin-chan won’t know what hit him!
Step one: Accidental Close Proximity
As the bell rang, the teacher walked in and announced, "Alright, today we’ll be doing group work. Pair up with someone nearby."
Ai-chan immediately turned toward Shinchan.
"Shin-chan~ Let’s work together!" she beamed.
Shinchan, half-asleep, just muttered, "Sure."
Kazama, sensing danger, leaned over to Nene. "This… feels like a trap."
Nene, smirking, nodded. "Oh, it definitely is."
As the teacher distributed the assignment, Ai-chan executed step two: The Desk Lean-In.
She casually scooted her desk closer to Shinchan’s, resting her chin in her hand and looking at him with the most dazzling smile she could manage.
"So, Shin-chan~ What do you think about the problem?"
Shinchan glanced at the paper. "Hmm… the answer’s probably 'C'."
Ai-chan pouted. "You didn’t even read it."
Shinchan yawned. "And yet, I feel in my heart that I’m right."
Ai-chan fought the urge to facepalm. Fine. Time for Plan B!
Step three: The Accidental Hand Touch
She pretended to reach for her pen at the same time as Shinchan, making sure their fingers brushed against each other.
This was it. This was the moment!
Shinchan didn’t even blink. "Hey, you took my pen."
Ai-chan froze. "W-Wait, but I thought this was mine?"
"Nope." Shinchan took it back and continued writing.
Kazama, watching this from the side, muttered, "How is he this dense?"
Masao whispered back, "Maybe he’s just choosing to be dense."
Bo-chan took a bite of his snack. "Or he’s just Shinchan."
Ai-chan clenched her fists. Alright. It’s time for the ultimate move.
Step four: The Whisper Attack
Ai-chan leaned in close—very close—to Shinchan’s ear.
"Shin-chan~" she whispered, her breath lightly brushing against his skin.
This was peak shoujo manga technique. If this didn’t get a reaction, nothing would.
And then…
Nothing.
Shinchan, unfazed, just turned his head and said, "You have really good breath. What toothpaste do you use?"
Ai-chan nearly fell out of her chair.
WHAT KIND OF REACTION IS THAT?!
Nene was barely holding back laughter. Kazama looked exhausted just from watching this unfold.
Ai-chan, determined to get some reaction, pulled out her final move.
Step five: The Classic "Trip and Fall" Strategy
As the group work ended and the bell rang, Ai-chan carefully staged her fall. She timed it perfectly so that when she "tripped" over the leg of her chair, she would fall right into Shinchan’s arms.
But.
Shinchan—without even looking—stepped aside at the last second.
Ai-chan landed face-first on the floor.
The entire class went silent.
Masao whispered, "Oof."
Nene winced. "That one looked like it hurt."
Kazama rubbed his temples. "Ai-chan, are you okay?"
Ai-chan shot up, rubbing her nose. "Y-Yes! That was… totally on purpose!"
Shinchan, watching her with mild curiosity, tilted his head. "You sure fall a lot."
Ai-chan forced a smile. "I-It’s called graceful clumsiness! It’s a charm point!"
Bo-chan, ever the realist, calmly said, "It didn’t look graceful."
Ai-chan internally screamed.

The Unexpected Reaction
After school, Ai-chan sighed, dragging her feet as she walked home with Shinchan and the gang.
"I can’t believe nothing worked…" she muttered under her breath.
Nene patted her shoulder. "Hey, at least it was entertaining."
Kazama, carrying his bag like a businessman exhausted from life, added, "If that’s any consolation."
Masao nodded. "I thought you were gonna get through to him at least once."
Bo-chan simply said, "Try again tomorrow."
Ai-chan groaned. What does it take to make this boy react?!
But just then—just barely noticeable—Shinchan walked slightly ahead, hands in his pockets, glancing at the sky.
A very, very small smirk crossed his lips.
No one noticed.
Except Ai-chan.
Her eyes widened. Wait… was that…?
It was only for a second. A blink-and-you-miss-it moment. But it was there.
And for Ai-chan, that was enough.
She clenched her fists with newfound determination.
Shin-chan… I will make you flustered one day!
With that, Operation: "Make Shin-chan Blush!" was officially marked as a partial success.

End of Chapter 12
This chapter had Ai-chan going all out with her plans while Shinchan almost reacted—just enough to keep things progressing, but not too much. Let me know if you want any tweaks before moving on to Chapter 13!
You said:
i want to make a change while she is trying all this the other 4 are dying trying not to laugh.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! I’ll revise the chapter to include Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Bo-chan struggling to hold back their laughter while Ai-chan is desperately trying her moves on Shinchan. I’ll update it now.

Chapter 12: The Great Ai-chan Operation
It was a calm afternoon at school. The sun was shining, birds were chirping, and Shinchan was blissfully napping on the classroom desk while Kazama was furiously flipping through his notes.

She had spent all night researching techniques from romance manga, dating advice blogs, and even some questionable "How to Make Your Crush Notice You!" articles. Today, she was going all in.
Shin-chan won’t know what hit him!
In the background, Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Bo-chan were already exchanging glances, sensing what was coming. Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Oh no... she’s planning something."
Masao gulped. "I have a feeling this is gonna be painful to watch…"
Nene smirked. "Painful for her, maybe. Hilarious for us!"
Bo-chan simply nodded, munching on his snack. "It’s happening."

Step one: Accidental Close Proximity
As the bell rang, the teacher walked in and announced, "Alright, today we’ll be doing group work. Pair up with someone nearby."
Ai-chan immediately turned toward Shinchan.
"Shin-chan~ Let’s work together!" she beamed.
Shinchan, half-asleep, just muttered, "Sure."
Kazama subtly elbowed Nene, who was already biting her lip to stop herself from laughing. Masao was shaking slightly. Bo-chan remained impassive but was clearly watching this unfold.
As the teacher distributed the assignment, Ai-chan executed step two: The Desk Lean-In.
She casually scooted her desk closer to Shinchan’s, resting her chin in her hand and looking at him with the most dazzling smile she could manage.
"So, Shin-chan~ What do you think about the problem?"
Shinchan glanced at the paper. "Hmm… the answer’s probably 'C'."
Ai-chan pouted. "You didn’t even read it."
Shinchan yawned. "And yet, I feel in my heart that I’m right."
Kazama had to physically cover his mouth. Nene had her head down, pretending to write, but her shoulders were shaking. Masao was turning red—not from embarrassment, but from holding in his laughter. Bo-chan chewed a little slower than usual.

Step three: The Accidental Hand Touch
Ai-chan pretended to reach for her pen at the same time as Shinchan, making sure their fingers brushed against each other.
This was it. This was the moment!
Shinchan didn’t even blink. "Hey, you took my pen."
Ai-chan froze. "W-Wait, but I thought this was mine?"
"Nope." Shinchan took it back and continued writing.
Kazama choked on his own breath, making a small wheezing sound. Nene’s hand flew to her mouth, her face contorted in sheer effort to not burst out laughing. Masao had his head down, shaking violently. Bo-chan blinked, impressed.

Step four: The Whisper Attack
Ai-chan leaned in close—very close—to Shinchan’s ear.
"Shin-chan~" she whispered, her breath lightly brushing against his skin.
This was peak shoujo manga technique. If this didn’t get a reaction, nothing would.
And then…
Nothing.
Shinchan, unfazed, just turned his head and said, "You have really good breath. What toothpaste do you use?"
Nene snorted. Kazama’s face turned purple. Masao actually fell off his chair. Bo-chan… simply nodded in admiration.
Ai-chan nearly fell out of her chair.
WHAT KIND OF REACTION IS THAT?!

Step five: The Classic "Trip and Fall" Strategy
As the group work ended and the bell rang, Ai-chan carefully staged her fall. She timed it perfectly so that when she "tripped" over the leg of her chair, she would fall right into Shinchan’s arms.
But.
Shinchan—without even looking—stepped aside at the last second.
Ai-chan landed face-first on the floor.
Kazama dropped his book and howled. Nene slammed her hands against the desk, shaking. Masao was crying. Bo-chan took a slow sip of his juice box.
The entire class went silent.
Masao whispered, "Oof."
Nene wheezed, "That one looked like it hurt."
Kazama wiped a tear. "Ai-chan… this is legendary…"
Ai-chan shot up, rubbing her nose. "Y-Yes! That was… totally on purpose!"
Shinchan, watching her with mild curiosity, tilted his head. "You sure fall a lot."
Ai-chan forced a smile. "I-It’s called graceful clumsiness! It’s a charm point!"
Bo-chan, ever the realist, calmly said, "It didn’t look graceful."
Ai-chan internally screamed.

The Unexpected Reaction
After school, Ai-chan sighed, dragging her feet as she walked home with Shinchan and the gang.
"I can’t believe nothing worked…" she muttered.
Kazama chuckled. "It was magnificent though."
Nene patted her shoulder. "That was the best show I’ve seen in a while."
Masao, still wiping tears, nodded. "10 out of 10. No notes."
But just then—just barely noticeable—Shinchan walked slightly ahead, hands in his pockets, glancing at the sky.
A very, very small smirk crossed his lips.
No one noticed.
Except Ai-chan.
Her eyes widened. Wait… was that…?
She clenched her fists with newfound determination.
Shin-chan… I will make you flustered one day!
With that, Operation: "Make Shin-chan Blush!" was officially marked as a partial success.

End of Chapter 12
now chapter 13 is them giving their exam, rather the few hours before the exam start.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! Chapter 13 will focus on the chaotic, nerve-wracking, and comedic moments leading up to their exams—some cramming, some last-minute panicking, and of course, Shinchan being his usual self while the others react. I’ll write it now.

Chapter 13: Pre-Exam Panic and Shinchan’s Unbothered Aura
The air was thick with tension. The hallway was unusually silent. Desperate whispers filled the space, as students flipped through pages, eyes wide with stress.
It was the final few hours before the midterm exams.
And naturally, chaos had erupted.

T-minus 2 Hours: Kazama’s Meltdown
Kazama was pacing back and forth in the classroom, flipping through his notes at the speed of light. His glasses slid down his nose as he mumbled formulas under his breath.
"Quadratic equations… No! What if they throw in a word problem with a trick question?! I should revise probability too! But what about history?! What if they ask about 17th-century trade routes?!"
Shinchan, leaning back in his chair with his arms crossed, yawned. "Kazama, I think you need to trade some of that panic for a nap."
Kazama whipped his head toward him. "NAP?! NAP?! We have a math exam in two hours! How are you not worried?!"
Shinchan shrugged. "Worrying doesn’t make the answers magically appear."
Kazama’s left eye twitched.
Masao, sitting beside them, looked even worse. He was hunched over his desk, clutching his head. His notes were a chaotic mess of scribbles and erased mistakes. "I-I think I’ve forgotten everything… Was history always this long? Who even cares about what happened 500 years ago?! I'm not an archaeologist!"
Bo-chan, flipping through his notes at a slow, steady pace, took a sip of juice. "You should’ve studied earlier."
Masao clutched his heart. "Bo-chan… that hurts."
Nene was reading over her notes at a fast but manageable pace. Unlike the boys, she was stressed, but functional. "Okay, okay, we still have time. If we go over the formulas once more, maybe—"
Suddenly, she froze.
She had made the grave mistake of turning to her right.
And there sat Shinchan.
Relaxed. Unbothered. Not even holding a pen.
He was casually balancing a pencil on his upper lip like a mustache.
Nene’s blood pressure spiked. "SHINCHAN! WHY AREN’T YOU REVIEWING?!"
Shinchan blinked. "Huh? Oh, I already went over everything."
Kazama, Nene, and Masao stopped.
Masao squinted. "Wait… so you did study?"
"Of course." Shinchan stretched lazily. "I read through my notes once and memorized the key stuff. No need to stress."
Silence.
Kazama looked like he wanted to strangle him. Nene gripped her chair like it was the only thing keeping her from exploding. Masao’s mouth opened and closed like a goldfish.
"You… memorized everything after one read-through?" Kazama’s voice was dangerously low.
"Yeah," Shinchan said with a shrug. "It’s not that hard if you don’t overthink it."
Kazama’s soul left his body.
Nene looked like she was about to combust. "You mean to tell me that I stayed up all night drinking energy drinks, trying to cram a month’s worth of studying, and YOU just glanced at your notes and called it a day?!"
Shinchan nodded. "Yep."
Nene grabbed a textbook and almost threw it at him. "I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS!"
Masao, still in shock, turned to Kazama. "Does this mean… he’s actually… smart?"
Kazama, whose entire existence was built on hard work and relentless studying, looked devastated. "I refuse to accept this reality."
Bo-chan nodded, munching on a snack. "Shinchan is smart. He just doesn’t care."
The room went silent again.
Then, as if on cue, Kazama let out a frustrated scream into his notebook.

T-minus 1 Hour: The Cramming Zone
As the clock ticked closer to exam time, the atmosphere in the classroom grew even more intense. Some students were desperately cramming, others had given up and were staring blankly at their desks.
Ai-chan, having finished reviewing early, walked into the room gracefully. "Oh? How is everyone feeling?"
"LIKE I'M GOING TO DIE!" Masao wailed.
"LIKE THE WORLD IS ENDING!" Kazama added.
Ai-chan giggled. "Now, now, exams aren’t that bad." She turned to Shinchan. "I assume you studied properly?"
Shinchan stretched again. "I’m chilling."
Kazama slammed his head on his desk. "HOW?! HOW CAN YOU BE SO RELAXED?!"
Ai-chan smiled. "Shin-chan is just confident in his abilities, right?"
Shinchan tilted his head. "Not really. If I fail, I fail. Life goes on."
Kazama let out another muffled scream.

T-minus 15 Minutes: The Toilet Rush
With minutes left before the test, students started frantically making their last-minute preparations.
Masao, looking like he was about to throw up, clutched his stomach. "O-Oh no… I think I need to use the bathroom…"
Kazama’s eyes widened. "NOW?! Are you insane?! You won’t make it back in time!"
Masao grabbed Kazama by the shoulders, shaking him. "IF I DON’T GO NOW, I’LL FAIL BOTH THE EXAM AND LIFE ITSELF!"
And with that, he sprinted out of the classroom.
Nene sighed, flipping through her notes one last time. "I swear, this school is full of idiots."
Bo-chan, calmly packing away his notes, turned to Shinchan. "You’re really not worried?"
Shinchan shook his head. "Nope. I already planned out my post-exam snack."
Bo-chan nodded approvingly. "That’s important."
Ai-chan laughed. "I suppose I should admire your confidence, Shin-chan." She leaned in, giving him a playful look. "If you get a high score, maybe I’ll give you a reward~"
Kazama perked up. "Wait, what kind of reward?!"
Shinchan smirked. "Ooh, if it’s a fancy meal, I’m in."
Ai-chan pouted. "That’s not what I meant…"
Nene rolled her eyes. "Boys are hopeless."
Just then, Masao burst back into the room, panting. "I barely made it…"
The teacher walked in with a stack of exam papers. "Alright, everyone, take your seats. It’s time."
A wave of stress washed over the class.
Except for one person.
Shinchan simply leaned back and smirked. "Let’s get this over with."
Kazama glared at him. "I hate you so much right now."
And with that, the exam began.

Chapter 14: The Exam Marathon Begins
The moment the teacher placed the exam papers on the desks, a heavy silence fell over the classroom.
Kazama sat upright, gripping his pen like it was a sword in battle. Masao was already sweating, muttering prayers under his breath. Bo-chan remained his usual unbothered self, while Nene tapped her pencil against her desk, taking deep breaths.
Shinchan?
He was leaning back in his chair, twirling his pen, completely relaxed.
"Alright, you may begin," the teacher announced.
The sound of pages flipping filled the room.

First Exam: Mathematics (9:00 AM - 10:00 AM)
Kazama instantly started scribbling down answers, his brain working at full speed. Equations, graphs, percentages—it was his battlefield, and he was determined to win.
Masao, on the other hand, had entered survival mode. His eyes darted between the questions and his brain, searching for any trace of knowledge. "Think, Masao, think!" he screamed internally.
Nene was solving at a steady pace, her focus unwavering. Bo-chan was moving at his own slow but confident speed, unfazed by the tension around him.
And Shinchan?
He glanced at the questions, cracked his fingers, and within ten minutes, had already filled out half the paper.
Kazama, noticing this, nearly choked on his own stress. "HOW? HOW IS HE THIS FAST?!"
Shinchan caught his stare and smirked. He slowly turned his paper upside down and started doodling a mustache on a stick figure.
Kazama nearly exploded.
When the teacher finally called time, Kazama slammed his pencil down in exhaustion, Masao looked like he had fought death itself, and Shinchan? He stretched and yawned.
"That was fun," he muttered.
Kazama was on the verge of flipping a table.

Break #1: 20 Minutes of Chaos (10:00 AM - 10:20 AM)
The second they stepped out of the classroom, Masao collapsed onto a bench.
"I'M DEAD. IT'S OVER. I'LL NEVER RECOVER FROM THIS," he wailed dramatically.
Nene sighed, stretching her arms. "It wasn’t that bad."
Kazama shook his head. "It wasn’t that bad?! It was an intense, mind-bending challenge!" He turned to Shinchan, pointing an accusing finger. "And YOU! How did you finish so fast?!"
Shinchan shrugged. "It was easy. Did you even read the questions properly?"
Kazama looked like he was about to throw hands.
Ai-chan, watching this unfold, giggled. "Shin-chan is quite capable when he wants to be."
Masao groaned. "I need a snack. I need something to bring me back to life."
Bo-chan, already munching on a rice cracker, handed him one. "Here."
Masao took it with tears in his eyes. "Bo-chan… you’re a lifesaver."
Ai-chan smiled. "Well, you better recover fast, because next is…"
Kazama went pale. "…History."
Masao screamed.

Second Exam: History (10:20 AM - 11:20 AM)
The moment the paper landed in front of Masao, he knew he was doomed.
The first question was already a nightmare.
"Who was the third shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate, and what were his major policies?"
Masao stared at the words, hoping they would change into something easier.
They did not.
He turned to Shinchan, who was already halfway through his answers, again.
Kazama had gone into full warrior mode, his pen moving so fast that it looked like smoke would start coming out of it.
Nene had a determined glint in her eyes. Bo-chan took his time, while Ai-chan gracefully wrote down her answers without a single ounce of worry.
Masao?
He began playing "Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe" on the multiple-choice questions.
When time was called, he placed his forehead against the desk. "Goodbye, world."
Kazama sighed, rubbing his temples. "At least that one was manageable."
Shinchan leaned back. "That was kinda fun."
Kazama twitched. "Fun? FUN?!"
Bo-chan nodded. "The questions were interesting."
Kazama took deep breaths before he lost his sanity.

Break #2: Survival Mode (11:20 AM - 11:40 AM)
Masao had lost the will to live.
He lay on the hallway floor, staring at the ceiling. "My ancestors are ashamed of me."
Kazama sat next to him, eating a rice ball. "At least you’re consistent."
Ai-chan was drinking tea like she was in a peaceful garden. "I quite enjoyed that test."
Nene sipped on her juice box. "Same. I think I did well."
Masao sat up dramatically. "TRAITORS."
Shinchan pulled out a small snack and started munching. "It’s not that deep, Masao."
Masao pointed at him. "You don’t get to talk! You’re somehow cruising through these exams without even trying!"
Shinchan smirked. "Sounds like a you problem."
Kazama almost threw his rice ball at him.
Ai-chan giggled. "Alright, everyone, focus. Next up…"
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Science."
Masao groaned. "Just bury me already."

Third Exam: Science (11:40 AM - 12:40 PM)
Kazama, Ai-chan, and Nene were in their element. Chemical equations, physics formulas, and biology terms—it was all second nature to them.
Shinchan, surprisingly, was also breezing through the exam. He filled out the entire paper in record time and, just to mess with Kazama, leaned back and stared at the ceiling like he had ascended to another plane of existence.
Kazama could feel his blood pressure rising.
Masao?
He had accepted his fate.
"If I write in cursive, maybe they won’t notice my wrong answers."
Time was up, and the students poured out of the classroom.
Kazama was still recovering from the fact that Shinchan had finished before him. Again.

Final Break: 20 Minutes Until Doom (12:40 PM - 1:00 PM)
Masao was now a shell of a person. "Only one more… I just have to survive one more…"
Bo-chan nodded. "Language exams are usually easier."
Ai-chan smiled. "Just think of it as reading comprehension. You'll be fine."
Masao clung to Bo-chan’s sleeve. "If I don’t make it, tell my mom I love her."
Shinchan stretched. "I’m already thinking about lunch."
Kazama glared at him. "I don’t understand how you exist."
Shinchan smirked. "Skill issue."
Kazama was about to explode.

Final Exam: Japanese Language (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM)
At this point, everyone was exhausted.
Kazama powered through, determined to end strong. Nene was still going at a steady pace. Ai-chan had a serene smile as she wrote, while Bo-chan remained his usual unbothered self.
Shinchan finished early again and spent the rest of the time drawing mustaches on historical figures in the textbook.
Masao?
He had accepted defeat.
When the final bell rang, signaling the end of the exam, the entire class let out a collective sigh of relief.
Masao collapsed onto his desk. "It’s over… I survived…"
Kazama wiped his forehead. "Barely."
Shinchan stretched. "So, what’s for lunch?"
Kazama stared at him. "…I hate you."

Chapter 15: Post-Exam Feast and Unexpected Counters
The moment the final exam ended, a collective wave of exhaustion washed over the group.
Masao dramatically slumped over a desk. "I can finally… live again…"
Kazama rubbed his temples. "Barely."
Nene stretched her arms. "Alright, we deserve a reward. Let’s go eat somewhere."
Ai-chan smiled. "That sounds wonderful. I know a nice place nearby."
Shinchan grinned. "As long as they have meat, I’m in."
Bo-chan simply nodded in approval.

A Short Walk to the Restaurant
The group made their way to a local family restaurant—a cozy spot with booth seating and a wide variety of food options. The second they stepped inside, Shinchan immediately spotted the all-you-can-eat menu and practically sparkled.
"This place… it was made for me," he whispered in awe.
Kazama sighed. "Just don’t go overboard."
Nene, flipping through the menu, raised an eyebrow. "I give him five minutes before he orders the entire menu."
Masao, already drooling, muttered, "I support that idea."
They settled into their seats, placing their orders. Masao, of course, went for the biggest burger on the menu. Kazama chose something balanced, while Ai-chan picked something elegant, like a fancy pasta dish. Nene and Bo-chan went for simpler meals.
And Shinchan?
He had already ordered an absurd amount of food.
Kazama sighed. "Why am I not surprised?"
Shinchan smirked. "Because deep down, you admire my way of life."
Kazama nearly choked on his drink.

Food, Chaos, and Casual Conversation
As their meals arrived, the table was soon filled with sizzling plates, steaming bowls, and the scent of freshly cooked food.
Masao took a bite of his burger and nearly cried. "This… this is what happiness tastes like."
Nene shook her head. "You’re so dramatic."
Ai-chan twirled her pasta elegantly. "Still, this is a nice way to relax after exams."
Kazama nodded. "At least now we can take a break before the results come out."
Shinchan, his mouth full of grilled meat, casually added, "I wouldn’t worry too much."
Kazama squinted at him. "Easy for you to say. You just breeze through everything."
Shinchan grinned. "Not my fault you guys make studying look hard."
Kazama took deep breaths. "I’m going to ignore that."
As the group continued eating, the conversation shifted to lighter topics—future school events, upcoming plans, and how Masao swore he had seen a ghost in the hallway the other day (which was most definitely just a janitor).
Eventually, one by one, they finished their meals and began heading home.

Heading Home, Just the Two of Them
By the time everyone else had left, only Shinchan and Ai-chan remained.
The evening air was cool, and the streets were quieter now. They walked side by side, the streetlights casting a warm glow on the pavement.
Ai-chan stole a glance at Shinchan.
Alright, this is it. This is my chance.
She had been planning this moment—creating the perfect opportunity to catch him off guard, maybe get a rare blush out of him.
She smiled sweetly. "Shin-chan, do you mind if I ask something?"
Shinchan yawned. "Hmm? Go for it."
Ai-chan slowed her steps, clasping her hands behind her back, her expression soft and affectionate.
"If I told you that I was really happy to be back… that I missed you all these years… what would you say?"
She tilted her head, her eyes shimmering under the streetlight. She was aiming for a perfect, romantic atmosphere.
For once, Shinchan didn’t respond immediately. He just looked at her, a thoughtful expression on his face.
Ai-chan’s heart began to race. Is he actually flustered?! Did I finally catch him off guard?!
Then, he smirked.
"You missed me that much, huh?"
Ai-chan blinked.
"W-Well, obviously—"
Shinchan suddenly leaned in slightly, lowering his voice.
"Should I make it up to you, then?"
Ai-chan froze.
Wait.
What?
Her mind short-circuited. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.
She had expected him to brush it off, make some dumb joke, not this.
She tried to speak, but her brain had stopped working.
Shinchan, watching her face slowly turn red, chuckled.
"See ya, Ai-chan."
And with that, he turned and walked off, leaving Ai-chan standing there, completely flustered, a blushing mess.
She buried her face in her hands. "H-He turned it around on me…!"
Her plan had completely backfired.
And worst of all?
She liked it.

Chapter 16: Clash of the Grandparents
The exams were over, the stress had finally died down, and the long-awaited holiday break had arrived. For Shinchan, that meant only one thing—his family was going back to visit his grandparents.
Shinchan yawned as he dragged his suitcase down the stairs. "Man, why do we have to travel so far? Can’t they just come here?"
Misae, busy stuffing extra clothes into a bag, shot him a look. "Don’t be ridiculous. They’re old, and besides, it’s been a while since we all visited together."
Himawari, holding a small pink travel bag, twirled around. "I’m gonna show Grandpa my cute new dresses!"
Hiroshi stretched, cracking his back. "It’ll be nice to relax for a bit. No work, just food and naps."
Misae smirked. "And avoiding my dad’s lectures, right?"
Hiroshi went silent.
Shinchan grinned. "Dad’s gonna get grilled again, huh?"
Misae sighed. "As always. Alright, everyone, let’s go!"
And with that, the Nohara family embarked on their holiday trip.

Unexpected Reunion at the Grandparents' House
The train ride was uneventful, filled with Shinchan’s usual antics, Himawari’s insistence on taking selfies with every scenic view, and Hiroshi dozing off while Misae constantly checked their bags.
When they finally arrived at Misae’s parents' home in Kumamoto, something felt… off.
For one, there were extra shoes at the entrance.
And the moment they stepped inside—
"Ah, Hiroshi! Welcome back!"
Hiroshi’s mother, Gin, greeted them with a warm smile, waving from the living room.
Misae blinked. "Wait… what?"
Shinchan peered past her. "Ohhh, Grandpa Ginnosuke’s here too!"
And there he was—Hiroshi’s father, Ginnosuke, sitting on the couch, casually sipping tea like he belonged there.
The atmosphere instantly shifted.
Misae’s father, Yoshiji, stood in the corner, arms crossed, his face twitching.
"Can someone explain to me why my daughter’s in-laws are in my house?" he grumbled.
Hiroshi scratched his cheek. "Uhh, Dad, Mom… what are you doing here?"
Ginnosuke, in his usual carefree tone, shrugged. "Well, we figured, ‘Hey, why spend the holidays alone when we can visit the grandkids?’ So we came over!"
Gin nodded happily. "It’s been so long since we all gathered together."
Yoshiji looked like he was holding back a headache. "Without asking?!"
Shinchan, enjoying the chaos, plopped onto the floor. "Heh, this is great."
Misae sighed, rubbing her temples. "Dad, don’t be so grumpy. It’s just for a few days."
Yoshiji groaned. "That’s what I’m afraid of…"
Meanwhile, both grandmothers were already chatting like best friends, Himawari was being showered with attention, and Shinchan was lounging like he owned the place.
Hiroshi quietly leaned over to Misae. "This is going to be a long holiday, isn’t it?"
Misae sighed. "Definitely."
And so, the Nohara family's holiday began—with unexpected guests, family drama, and the classic clash of grandfathers.

Chapter 17: The Battle of the Grandfathers
The first full day of the Nohara family’s holiday had barely begun, and already, tensions were brewing.
The morning started out peaceful enough. Misae and Gin were in the kitchen preparing breakfast, Himawari was busy flaunting her new outfits to her grandmothers, and Hiroshi was still half-asleep on the tatami mat.
Then came the problem—Yoshiji and Ginnosuke.
Shinchan sat cross-legged at the table, lazily munching on a rice cracker as he watched the two old men glare at each other across the room.
"So," Yoshiji said, his arms crossed. "How long do you plan on freeloading in my house?"
Ginnosuke took a slow sip of tea, completely unfazed. "As long as my beloved grandchildren need me."
"You mean my grandchildren?" Yoshiji retorted.
Ginnosuke chuckled. "Oh? Last I checked, my son made them, so technically—"
"THEY'RE MY DAUGHTER'S KIDS!" Yoshiji snapped.
The air crackled with competitive energy.
Shinchan grinned. "Ohhh, this is getting good."
Misae groaned. "Not even one full day… Can you two at least try to get along?"
But it was too late.
The battle had begun.

Grandfather Challenge #1: Who’s the Better Cook?
The first challenge came unexpectedly when Yoshiji declared, "If you’re going to stay here, you better not be dead weight. Can you even cook properly?"
Ginnosuke smirked. "I was a master at running my old shop. Unlike you, I know how to make food people actually enjoy."
And so, the first contest began: a breakfast cook-off.
The kitchen was soon turned into a battlefield.
On one side, Yoshiji worked with precision, making a traditional Japanese breakfast with grilled fish, miso soup, and perfectly cooked rice.
On the other side, Ginnosuke—much less disciplined but confident—prepared a full-on feast with extravagant omelets, karaage, and fancy miso soup filled with expensive ingredients.
By the time they were done, the entire dining table was covered in food.
Shinchan’s eyes sparkled. "Ohhh, jackpot!"
Himawari clapped. "It all looks so good!"
Misae, looking exasperated, sighed. "We’re supposed to be here to relax, not to watch you two compete."
But at this point, neither grandfather was listening.
"Now then," Ginnosuke said. "Let’s see whose food is better."
Yoshiji huffed. "Fine by me."
The family hesitated, looking at the massive amount of food before them. Then, with hunger winning over exhaustion, they all dug in.
The result?
…it was all delicious.
Misae groaned. "So much for settling the argument."
Shinchan, mouth full of karaage, grinned. "Yeah, but we’re the real winners here."
Yoshiji and Ginnosuke huffed, both declaring themselves the superior cook.
Round one? A draw.

Grandfather Challenge #2: Who’s Better with the Grandkids?
The second challenge was even more ridiculous.
After breakfast, Ginnosuke turned to Himawari and proudly declared, "Grandpa will buy you anything you want today, sweetheart!"
Not to be outdone, Yoshiji scoffed. "Ha! As if I’d let you steal my role. I’ll be the one to spoil her."
Himawari, always one to take advantage of a good deal, smiled sweetly. "Why not both?"
And so, the two grandfathers found themselves in an unspoken contest of who could spoil their granddaughter more.
They took her to the shopping district, where she picked out new clothes, accessories, and even some expensive beauty products—all paid for by her competing grandfathers.
By the time they got back home, Himawari was practically glowing with joy, her arms full of shopping bags.
Shinchan watched the chaos unfold, shaking his head. "Man, she really played them both like a fiddle."
Hiroshi muttered, "She’s going to be a terrifying woman when she grows up…"
Meanwhile, Yoshiji and Ginnosuke were left exhausted—and broke.
Another draw.

Grandfather Challenge #3: Who’s the Better Drinker?
That night, after a long day of competition, the two men finally found common ground—drinking.
Sitting together at the table, they clinked their sake cups, all hostility temporarily forgotten.
"You’re an annoying old man," Yoshiji muttered, taking a sip.
Ginnosuke chuckled. "Right back at ya."
Shinchan, watching them get progressively more drunk, leaned over to Misae. "Should we stop them?"
Misae sighed. "Nah, let them bond over their shared stupidity."
Himawari peeked in, looking at the two drunken grandfathers laughing together. "I think they like each other more than they say."
Hiroshi sighed. "At least for tonight, there’s peace."
And with that, the first day of the holiday ended—filled with absurd competitions, excessive food, and the chaotic warmth of family.

Chapter 18: The Journey Back Home
After days of chaos, competitions, and over-the-top family antics, the Nohara family’s visit to Kumamoto was finally coming to an end.
Misae stretched as she zipped up the last suitcase. "Alright, everything’s packed. Let’s get going before Dad finds another reason to pick a fight with Ginnosuke."
Shinchan, lying on the futon, sighed dramatically. "Man, I was just starting to enjoy watching them fight like an old-school samurai drama."
Himawari pouted. "I wanted to stay a little longer… Grandpa Ginnosuke said he’d take me to a fancy salon next time!"
Hiroshi, slinging his bag over his shoulder, muttered, "We need to leave before we go completely bankrupt."
Downstairs, the atmosphere was still tense.
Yoshiji and Ginnosuke stood at opposite ends of the living room, arms crossed, refusing to look at each other.
Gin, ever the peacemaker, smiled. "Oh, come on, you two. This was a nice visit, wasn’t it?"
Yoshiji grumbled. "Hmph. Maybe."
Ginnosuke smirked. "If you ever get lonely, old man, I might crash here again."
"Over my dead body!"
Shinchan giggled. "Aww, Grandpa Yoshiji, you’re gonna miss him, aren’t you?"
"LIKE HELL I AM!"
Misae rubbed her temples. "Alright, time to go before someone gets hit."
With all their luggage finally ready, the Nohara family said their goodbyes.
Gin hugged Himawari and ruffled Shinchan’s hair. "Be good, you two!"
Yoshiji huffed but still patted Himawari’s head. "Come back soon. Just… preferably alone next time."
Misae sighed. "We’ll see, Dad."
As they stepped outside, Ginnosuke grinned at Hiroshi. "Remember, son, if your father-in-law gives you trouble, just remind him you married his daughter despite her temper."
Misae’s glare was instant.
"YOU WANT ME TO KICK YOU OUT RIGHT NOW?!"
Shinchan whistled. "He really passed his survival instincts down to Dad, huh?"
With that, they finally left, heading toward the train station.

The Journey Back
The train ride home was quiet—at first.
Shinchan had taken the window seat, his head resting against the glass. The gentle rocking of the train was making him drowsy.
Misae, sitting next to him, flipped through her phone. Hiroshi was already knocked out, his head bobbing with the movement of the train.
Himawari, on the other hand, was fully awake.
"Shin-nii," she whispered.
"Hm?" Shinchan barely opened his eyes.
"Who do you think won between the grandpas?"
Shinchan smirked. "Hima, when two old men go head-to-head, the real winner is the one who eats for free and watches the chaos."
"…So you?"
"Exactly."
Himawari giggled.
After a while, Misae leaned back and sighed. "I swear, next time we visit, we’re making sure they ask before showing up."
Hiroshi mumbled in his sleep, "They’ll never listen…"
The train continued its journey, the gentle hum of the rails creating a strangely comforting atmosphere.
Eventually, the countryside gave way to the city, and the familiar buildings of Kasukabe came into view.

Back Home
As soon as they reached their house, Misae unlocked the door, and everyone immediately collapsed inside.
"We’re home…" Hiroshi muttered, face-first on the couch.
Shinchan flopped onto the floor. "Man, that was exhausting."
Himawari, still full of energy, stretched. "I wanna go out and show my friends the cool things Grandpa bought me!"
Misae groaned. "Nope. We’re resting today."
Hiroshi sighed. "Agreed. Let’s enjoy the peace while it lasts."
Shinchan smirked. "So, five minutes?"
Misae shot him a look. "Try thirty seconds if you keep talking."
And with that, the Nohara family settled back into their normal routine—though it was clear that "normal" in this household was always relative.

Chapter 19: The Grand Return & Exam Results Reveal
The first day back at school after the holidays had a strange energy—part exhaustion, part excitement, and a whole lot of dread. Students filled the halls, dragging their feet, already reminiscing about their vacations while simultaneously fearing what awaited them.
And for Shinchan and his friends, that fear was very real.
It was the day they would get their exam results.

The Reunion
Shinchan strolled into the classroom, hands behind his head, looking as carefree as ever.
"Ahh, back to prison after a short parole," he muttered dramatically.
"Shinchan!"
Before he could react, he was tackled from behind by a pair of arms wrapping around his shoulders.
Ai had arrived.
"You didn’t text me at all during the holidays!" she pouted.
"Ahh, that’s because the mountains don’t have WiFi," he replied, dodging the fact that he simply forgot.
Kazama, standing by the door, rolled his eyes. "That’s a lie and you know it."
Nene walked in, flipping her hair. "It’s called tactical ignoring, Ai-chan. You need to learn to counter it."
Ai let go of Shinchan and narrowed her eyes. "Oh? And you would know this how?"
Nene smirked. "Just call it experience."
Before Ai could interrogate her, Masao and Bo-chan finally entered.
Masao yawned. "Man, I already wanna go back home…"
Bo-chan nodded slowly. "Agreed."
"Alright, everyone, take your seats!" Their homeroom teacher, Kobayashi-sensei, entered, looking as exhausted as the students.
As they all sat down, the tension in the room shifted.
The results were coming.

The Reveal
Kobayashi-sensei tapped the stack of papers on his desk.
"Before we get to our lesson, I’ll be returning your exam results. Let’s see how well—or how terribly—you all did."
The classroom buzzed with nervous murmurs.
"Alright," the teacher continued, handing out the sheets. "Here you go, Nohara."
Shinchan lazily accepted the paper, barely glancing at it before setting it aside.
Kazama, who had already received his, was gripping the paper tightly, his eyes scanning the numbers.
Masao held his head in his hands, muttering, "Please, please, please…"
One by one, everyone got their results. And soon enough, they all had their scores in front of them.
And then—
"WAIT A DAMN MINUTE!"
Kazama practically leapt from his seat, pointing at Shinchan.
Shinchan blinked. "Hmm?"
"HOW?!" Kazama looked ready to combust. "You got a 100 in math?! A PERFECT SCORE?!"
The entire class turned.
Murmurs started up immediately.
"Nohara got a perfect score?"
"No way. That’s gotta be a mistake, right?"
"Is the world ending?"
Shinchan scratched his head. "I mean… yeah?"
Kazama looked like he was about to explode. "I STUDIED FOR WEEKS. I GOT A 98. AND YOU—"
Shinchan shrugged. "It’s just numbers on a paper, man. No big deal."
Kazama twitched. "NO BIG—?!"
Ai, meanwhile, had already analyzed all their scores.
"So… Shinchan scored higher than Kazama in math and science?"
Bo-chan, quietly looking at his own paper, added, "And he beat me in science too."
Nene scanned the results again. "Wait, wait, wait. If we put them in order… Shinchan ranks first in our group."
A stunned silence followed.
Masao whispered in awe, "Shinchan… is smart?"
Kazama grabbed his head in both hands. "I CAN’T ACCEPT THIS!"
Shinchan smirked. "If it makes you feel better, I didn’t even study that hard."
Kazama groaned. "That makes it worse!"
Ai crossed her arms, smirking. "I knew you were hiding your intelligence, Shin-chan."
Shinchan shrugged. "Not hiding. Just don’t care enough to show it."
Kazama flopped back into his chair, defeated.
Masao stared at his own scores. "At least I didn’t fail anything…"
Bo-chan, as always, remained calm. "Good job, everyone."
Kazama sighed, rubbing his temples. "You know what? Fine. It’s just one set of exams."
Shinchan smirked. "Whatever helps you sleep at night, Kazama."
And with that, the group officially returned to school life—with the shocking revelation that Shinchan was actually an academic powerhouse… not that he planned to let that information spread too far.
End of Chapter 19.

Chapter 19 (Continued): The Aftermath of the Exam Results
The shock in the classroom had mostly settled, but at Shinchan’s table, chaos was only beginning.
The group huddled together, still in disbelief. Kazama had his arms crossed, still brooding over the injustice of Shinchan’s scores, while Masao was scanning his own grades as if he could magically increase them through sheer willpower.
Meanwhile, Ai was staring at her score sheet, brows furrowed.
Kazama was the first to voice his thoughts. “Alright, I need to get something straight. You really didn’t study?”
Shinchan tilted his head. “I mean, I looked at the books a little.”
Kazama looked like he wanted to flip a table. “A little?!”
Nene, flipping her hair, smirked. “I guess some people are just naturally gifted.”
Kazama turned to her, eyes burning. “I studied for weeks. I had a schedule. A plan! And he—” He pointed at Shinchan like he was some unnatural phenomenon. “—just breezed through it?! How?!”
Shinchan smirked. “I dunno, Kazama. Maybe you’re just not as smart as me.”
Kazama twitched.
Ai chuckled. “Oh, this is amazing. I never thought I’d see the day when Kazama had an existential crisis over grades.”
Bo-chan, still looking at the scores, finally spoke up. “Nohara… got his highest marks after Ai-chan returned.”
Silence.
Everyone turned to Bo-chan, then to Ai.
Ai blinked. “Huh?”
Masao’s eyes widened in realization. “Oh… oh my god, that’s true!”
Kazama, already frustrated, slammed his hand on the table. “Wait a minute—”
Masao pointed dramatically. “Shinchan changed after Ai-chan came back!”
Ai’s face turned slightly pink. “Eh? W-what are you saying?”
Nene grinned. “Oh? So you’re saying that Ai-chan’s presence has inspired Shinchan to unlock his true potential?”
Masao gasped. “Does this mean Ai-chan is like… Shinchan’s muse?!”
Kazama shook his head violently. “No! No! That can’t be it! Shinchan has always been like this—right?! Right?!”
Shinchan rubbed his chin. “Hmm, I dunno… maybe Ai-chan did change me.”
Ai’s face turned bright red. “H-huh?!”
Shinchan sighed dramatically. “Maybe her return awakened something deep inside me… my hidden genius.”
Kazama choked on air.
Masao nodded solemnly. “That makes sense.”
Nene clasped her hands together. “Ai-chan’s love has made Shinchan into an intellectual powerhouse!”
Ai, now fully flustered, waved her hands. “W-wait, hold on, don’t twist this into something weird!”
Bo-chan, ever calm, added, “The numbers don’t lie.”
Ai groaned. “Bo-chan, not you too!”
Shinchan smirked at Ai’s flustered state. “Well, Ai-chan, I guess I should thank you. Maybe I’ll actually try a little harder from now on.”
Ai, trying to compose herself, cleared her throat. “Y-you should be trying your best all the time!”
Shinchan tilted his head. “But where’s the fun in that?”
Kazama threw his hands up. “I can’t believe this. Shinchan, who I thought was the dumbest person alive, is actually a genius who just doesn’t care?”
Masao crossed his arms. “It’s honestly a little disturbing to think about.”
Nene grinned. “And kind of cool.”
Ai pouted, still recovering from the teasing. “Hmph. I still got a 97 in history and a 99 in Japanese. That’s something to be proud of.”
Shinchan smirked. “But I still beat you in math and science.”
Ai twitched. “Don’t rub it in!”
Shinchan leaned in slightly, resting his chin on his hand. “Hey, you said you wanted to make me into a proper gentleman… but looks like you accidentally made me smarter instead.”
Ai turned away with a huff. “Hmph! I’ll make you both someday!”
The group laughed, while Ai buried her face in her score sheet, embarrassed beyond belief.
And so, the first day back at school continued—with Kazama still suffering an academic meltdown, and Shinchan discovering that teasing Ai-chan was way too fun.

Chapter 20: Running in Circles
The late morning sun was shining bright, casting long shadows on the school field as the students stood around in their P.E. uniforms, stretching lazily. The sports teacher, a gruff-looking man with arms crossed, scanned the gathered students with a menacing glint in his eyes.
“Alright! Today, we’re running laps!” he announced, causing a wave of groans to spread through the group.
Shinchan sighed dramatically. “Ah… the first day back from break and they already want us to die.”
Masao looked like he was already halfway to collapsing. “W-we’re really doing this right after exams…?”
Kazama adjusted his glasses, stretching with a serious expression. “Running is essential for stamina. Complaining won’t make it go away.”
Nene smirked. “Yeah, and unlike some people, I actually want to stay fit.”
Bo-chan remained silent as usual, but he was doing his stretches with perfect form.
Ai, standing beside Shinchan, flicked her ponytail back. “I personally don’t mind. It’s a good way to keep in shape.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Ai-chan, you walk like, five steps, and your bodyguards used to carry you the rest of the way. You’re not exactly an expert.”
Ai huffed. “Excuse me, but I’ve been doing personal training! I can handle a few laps just fine!”
The teacher clapped his hands. “Enough talking! We’re doing relay teams! Get into groups of three!”
The students scrambled to form teams. Naturally, Shinchan, Masao, and Bo-chan ended up together, while Kazama, Ai, and Nene formed another team.
Masao’s face fell. “We’re doomed.”
Shinchan patted him on the back. “Don’t worry, buddy! Just think of it as running for your life.”
Masao paled. “That’s not comforting at all!”
The whistle blew. The first runners bolted off, with Shinchan and Ai leading for their teams.
Ai ran gracefully, maintaining a steady pace. Meanwhile, Shinchan…
Jogged. At a leisurely pace.
Kazama clenched his fists. “Shinchan! RUN!”
Shinchan gave him a thumbs-up. “I am running.”
Ai smirked as she passed him. “Oh? Is that all the speed you’ve got?”
Shinchan yawned mid-run. “Gotta conserve energy, y’know?”
Ai’s competitive side flared up. “Hah! Guess I’ll be winning this, then!”
Shinchan shrugged and let her pull ahead—until they reached the baton pass.
In the blink of an eye, Shinchan casually flicked the baton to Bo-chan, who took off like a machine, overtaking Ai’s team instantly.
Kazama’s jaw dropped. “W-wait, what—”
Masao screamed. “BO-CHAN IS A BEAST!”
Nene and Ai stood frozen, watching as Bo-chan calmly ran like he was floating on air.
Ai clenched her fists. “I won’t lose that easily!”
She passed the baton to Kazama, who ran with determination, overtaking Bo-chan by a slim margin.
And then… Masao took the baton.
Kazama realized his mistake immediately.
Masao tripped on the first step.
Kazama facepalmed. “We’re doomed.”
Meanwhile, Shinchan leaned against a tree, drinking water. “Ahh, refreshing.”
Ai turned to him, irritated. “You totally could’ve run faster.”
Shinchan grinned. “Maybe.”
Ai glared. “Maybe?!”
Nene sighed. “Some things never change.”
After what felt like forever, Masao finally crossed the finish line, wheezing.
The P.E. teacher sighed. “Alright, that’s enough running for today. Now, club activities begin.”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Finally, something useful.”
Nene turned to Shinchan. “Hey, aren’t you thinking of rejoining the Kendo club?”
Ai perked up. “Oh? Shin-chan in a club?”
Shinchan scratched his cheek. “Ehhh, I dunno…”
Kazama frowned. “You were clearly good at it when we saw you practicing.”
Ai crossed her arms. “So? What’s holding you back?”
Shinchan stretched, looking away. “Nothin’. Just don’t feel like rushing into it.”
Bo-chan, ever the silent observer, nodded. “One step at a time.”
Ai narrowed her eyes. “Hmph. You better join soon.”
Shinchan chuckled. “Or what? You gonna fight me with a wooden sword?”
Ai smiled sweetly. “Maybe.”
Masao looked up. “Wait, does that mean we all have to join clubs?”
Kazama sighed. “Of course! It’s an important part of high school life!”
Nene smirked. “You just want an impressive club on your résumé.”
Kazama coughed. “That’s beside the point.”
As everyone discussed their club options, Shinchan leaned against the wall, watching them with a lazy smile.
Maybe he’d actually consider Kendo again…
But not today.

chapter 21 about the group going homw together, and falling into some antics.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 21: The Long Road Home (And the Chaos Along the Way)
The final school bell rang, and students poured out of the classrooms like water bursting from a dam.
Shinchan stretched lazily as he walked out with Kazama, Masao, Bo-chan, Nene, and Ai. “Ahhh, finally! Freedom!”
Nene rolled her eyes. “You act like we just got out of prison.”
Shinchan nodded sagely. “School is kinda like prison. We’re trapped for hours, doing forced labor, under the constant watch of our wardens.”
Kazama sighed. “Shinchan, that’s called ‘education.’”
Ai smirked. “Not that you have any right to complain, Mr. 100-on-the-math-exam.”
Masao pouted. “Seriously, you barely study! How are you so good at it?!”
Shinchan grinned. “Ah, a magician never reveals his secrets.”
Bo-chan, in his usual slow tone, added, “Maybe… he’s just a genius…”
Kazama nearly choked. “Don’t say things like that so casually!”
As they walked toward the school gate, Ai adjusted her bag. “So, are we all heading home together today?”
Nene nodded. “Of course! The exams are over, and I don’t feel like studying today.”
Masao gasped. “Wait… You actually study?”
Nene smacked him. “What do you think I do at home, draw manga?”
Shinchan blinked. “Wait, do you?”
Nene hesitated for a split second.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Ah. That confirms it.”
Nene turned red. “I-I didn’t say anything!!”
As they walked through the bustling streets, the group passed by a small arcade.
Shinchan suddenly stopped. “Ohhh. Haven’t been here in a while.”
Ai perked up. “Oh? Feeling nostalgic?”
Shinchan smirked. “I just remembered I was born to be a claw machine master.”
Kazama scoffed. “Born? More like scammed.”
Masao nodded. “Yeah! Every time you tried, you lost all your allowance!”
Shinchan grinned. “That was the old me. The new me has strategy.”
Nene crossed her arms. “Alright, let’s see it, then.”
The group entered the arcade, where bright lights and electronic sounds filled the air. Shinchan immediately marched up to the claw machine, cracking his knuckles.
Masao’s eyes widened. “Whoa. He looks serious.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Focused.”
Ai leaned against the machine. “Alright, Shin-chan, let’s make it interesting. If you can win something, I’ll…” She tapped her chin. “I’ll treat you to ice cream.”
Shinchan grinned. “Deal.”
Kazama frowned. “And if he loses?”
Ai smirked. “Then he has to buy me ice cream.”
Shinchan shrugged. “Fair enough.”
Masao gulped. “T-this is high-stakes gambling…”
Nene grinned. “This is pure entertainment.”
Shinchan inserted the coins and gripped the joystick. The group watched intently as he maneuvered the claw above a small stuffed penguin.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Too far left.”
Masao gasped. “He’s got it!”
The claw descended, grabbed the penguin, and—
Slipped right out of its grip.
Kazama sighed. “Classic.”
Ai giggled. “Aw, don’t feel bad, Shin-chan. I was looking forward to free ice cream anyway.”
Shinchan smirked. “Oh? Who said I was done?”
He inserted more coins.
Nene raised an eyebrow. “Careful. This is how people end up broke.”
Ignoring her, Shinchan adjusted his grip, aiming for a different prize—a small keychain of a samurai.
The claw went down…
Gripped the keychain…
And successfully dropped it into the prize slot.
The entire group froze.
Masao’s jaw dropped. “HE ACTUALLY WON?!”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Huh. That’s… surprising.”
Ai’s smile faltered. “W-wait, hold on—”
Shinchan casually picked up the keychain and tossed it to Ai. “Here ya go. Since you lost the bet, I expect a large ice cream.”
Ai gawked at him. “Y-you… you tricked me!”
Shinchan grinned. “Nope. You tricked yourself.”
Nene burst out laughing. “Oh, this is the best thing ever.”
Ai pouted, her face turning red. “Ughhh, fine! But don’t expect me to go easy next time!”
The group continued their walk, stopping by an ice cream shop where Ai begrudgingly paid for Shinchan’s treat.
As they finally neared their homes, Masao sighed contently. “Ahh, this was fun.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Good day.”
Kazama checked his watch. “Well, we should probably start heading in.”
Shinchan stretched. “Alright. See you guys tomorrow.”
As he turned to leave, Ai called out, “Hey, Shin-chan.”
He glanced back. “Hm?”
Ai smirked. “Next time, I win the bet.”
Shinchan took a bite of his ice cream and grinned. “We’ll see about that.”
With that, the group parted ways, another day of antics behind them—though knowing them, tomorrow wouldn’t be any less chaotic.

next chapter 22, the changing of class president and the aspect of student council being introduced to the first years.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 22: Student Council, Elections, and Shinchan’s Unwavering Laziness
The morning started off as usual. The bell rang, students shuffled to their seats, and Shinchan barely managed to avoid being late—though only because Ai had yanked him by the collar at the school gates.
But today wasn’t just any day.
“Alright, class,” their homeroom teacher announced, clapping his hands together. “As you all know, we’ll be electing the new class president today. Also, for first years, today marks the official introduction of the Student Council and the recruitment period.”
Kazama’s eyes immediately sharpened.
Shinchan yawned.
The teacher continued, “Now, before we start the election, does anyone want to step down from their current role?”
At the front of the class, their existing class president—a serious-looking boy with neatly combed hair—raised his hand. “Sir, I would like to step down due to my responsibilities in the debate club.”
A murmur spread through the class.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “I see. That means a power vacuum…”
Shinchan, resting his chin on his palm, sighed. “Why do you sound like we’re in a political drama?”
Masao, nibbling on his pen, whispered, “Who do you think will get picked?”
Before anyone could answer, the teacher smiled. “Alright. Who would like to nominate themselves or someone else?”
A girl in the front raised her hand. “I nominate Kazama.”
Kazama blinked. “Ah?”
Another student nodded. “Yeah, Kazama’s responsible and smart.”
“I second that!”
A few more murmurs of agreement followed.
Kazama slowly stood up, adjusting his tie. “Well, I suppose if the class believes I am the most qualified—”
“I nominate Shinchan,” Ai suddenly said.
The classroom went dead silent.
Kazama looked like he’d swallowed his own tongue. “WHAT?!”
Shinchan blinked lazily. “Huh?”
Nene grinned. “Ooooh, I like where this is going.”
Masao panicked. “A-Ai-chan, why would you do that?! If Shinchan is class president, we’ll all fail at life!”
Bo-chan, after a long pause, said, “Interesting.”
Ai smiled innocently. “I just think Shinchan has leadership qualities.”
Kazama turned to her. “Are you trying to destroy the class system?”
The teacher chuckled. “Alright, alright. Any more nominations?”
Another student hesitantly raised their hand. “Um… I think Nene-chan would do a good job too.”
Nene gasped. “Me?! Oh, well, I am responsible and hard-working.”
Kazama facepalmed. “How did we end up with these nominations?”
The teacher nodded. “Alright, then we have our three candidates: Kazama, Shinchan, and Nene. Let’s begin voting.”
The class grabbed their ballots.
A few minutes later, the results were revealed.
Kazama: 21 votes
 Nene: 8 votes
 Shinchan: 5 votes
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Wait. Five people actually voted for me?”
Ai winked. “I may have… influenced a few people.”
Kazama exhaled in relief. “Thank goodness.”
Shinchan shrugged. “Ah well. I didn’t want the job anyway.”
Nene pouted. “I didn’t expect to win, but I thought I’d at least beat Shinchan!”
Masao sighed. “Kazama is basically our dad. No one else stood a chance.”
Kazama nodded, straightening his tie. “Of course. Now, as class president, I shall ensure—”
The teacher interrupted, “Now that that’s settled, let’s move on to Student Council.”
Kazama froze mid-sentence.
The teacher smiled. “Starting today, first years can apply to join the Student Council. It’s a great opportunity for leadership, organization, and of course, it looks fantastic on college applications.”
Kazama’s face lit up like he’d just heard the words “free lifetime subscription to a law journal.”
Shinchan leaned back. “Oho. I see that glint in your eye, Kazama.”
Kazama smirked. “This… this is my true battlefield.”
Nene crossed her arms. “You just became class president, and you already want more power?”
Masao whispered to Bo-chan, “Kazama might be a villain in the making.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Definitely a final boss.”
The teacher continued, “Anyone interested can attend today’s Student Council orientation after school. They will explain the different roles and how to apply.”
Ai smiled at Kazama. “So? Are you going?”
Kazama stood tall. “Of course.”
Shinchan stretched. “Guess I’ll pass.”
Ai pouted. “Aw, you don’t want to join me?”
Shinchan chuckled. “I think the school would collapse if I joined the Student Council.”
Kazama muttered, “For once, I agree with you.”
The teacher clapped his hands again. “Alright, let’s move on with the lesson.”
As the school day went on, Kazama was practically vibrating with excitement for the orientation, while Shinchan simply drifted through the day as usual.
And as for Ai… she was already scheming her next move.

Chapter 23: Operation Student Council Takeover
Ai sat at her desk, her fingers steepled together, eyes gleaming with the kind of devious energy that sent shivers down Kazama’s spine.
Kazama, having known Ai the longest out of their friend group (excluding Shinchan), could already tell she was up to something. “...You’re plotting something, aren’t you?”
Ai turned to him with an innocent smile. “Why, Kazama-kun, whatever do you mean?”
Kazama rubbed his temples. “I know that look. That’s the same look you had when you bribed half the kindergarten class into giving you their pudding cups.”
Masao blinked. “She did what?”
Bo-chan nodded slowly. “Dark times.”
Shinchan, who had been half-listening while doodling on his notebook, finally looked up. “Huh? Oh, yeah, I remember that. Ai-chan was a little mafia boss back then.”
Ai giggled. “Oh, don’t exaggerate. I simply negotiated good deals.”
Nene smirked. “So? What’s your new ‘negotiation’ about?”
Ai’s smile widened. “I think Shin-chan should be Student Council President.”
Silence.
Kazama dropped his pencil. Nene almost choked on her drink. Masao looked like he was experiencing an existential crisis.
Shinchan blinked. “Pfft. Yeah, right.” He yawned and stretched. “I’d rather wrestle a bear than take on that job.”
Kazama shot up from his seat. “Ai! That is the worst possible idea! Shinchan in a leadership role would be a disaster of national proportions! He’s lazy! He’s unserious! He—”
Ai tilted her head, still smiling. “Oh? And yet he beat you in math and science?”
Kazama flinched. “T-That’s—That has nothing to do with leadership!”
Ai turned her gaze toward Shinchan. “You know, Shin-chan, being Student Council President comes with a lot of perks.”
Shinchan leaned back lazily. “Like what?”
Ai twirled a strand of hair around her finger. “Well… power, influence, popularity…”
Shinchan remained unimpressed. “Meh.”
Ai’s eyes narrowed. “And the president gets to decide things like school events, field trips, and—”
Shinchan’s eyes suddenly sparked with interest. “Wait. Field trips?”
Kazama paled. “Don’t listen to her! The Student Council doesn’t get that much power over them!”
Ai smirked. “Not directly, no… but they can make ‘suggestions.’ And if the president is charming enough…”
Shinchan rubbed his chin. “Hmmm.”
Kazama turned to Ai, exasperated. “You’re manipulating him with the promise of goofing off, aren’t you?!”
Ai giggled. “I prefer the term persuading.”
Masao whispered to Nene, “Should we be concerned that Ai-chan is way too good at this?”
Nene shrugged. “Honestly, it’s entertaining.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Like a movie.”
Kazama groaned. “Okay, let’s say by some twisted reality Shinchan actually becomes president. Who would be vice president?”
Ai placed a hand on her chest. “Naturally, me.”
Shinchan smirked. “Oho? You just wanna be my second-in-command, huh?”
Ai twirled a lock of hair. “Well, someone needs to make sure you actually do things.”
Kazama crossed his arms. “And the rest of us? What, are we getting roped into this too?”
Ai clapped her hands together. “Of course! Kazama, you’d be perfect as the secretary. You’re responsible, detail-oriented, and already acting like a stressed-out government official.”
Kazama twitched. “I refuse to be part of this madness!”
Ai ignored him and turned to Nene. “Nene-chan, you’d be great as the treasurer. You’re good with money, and you’re tough enough to make sure no one misuses the budget.”
Nene grinned. “Ooooh, I like the sound of that.”
Masao gulped. “W-What about me?”
Ai beamed. “Public relations! You have a friendly face, and you’d be good at communicating with students and making announcements.”
Masao puffed up. “H-Hey, that doesn’t sound too bad…”
Bo-chan tilted his head. “And me?”
Ai tapped her chin. “Hmm… Disciplinary committee?”
Bo-chan nodded once. “Okay.”
Shinchan smirked. “Yeah, I can see it. You just stare at people and they immediately behave.”
Kazama threw his hands in the air. “This is insanity! You can’t just force us all into the Student Council!”
Ai clasped her hands together and gave her best puppy-dog eyes. “Oh, Kazama-kun, wouldn’t it be fun to run the school together?”
Kazama narrowed his eyes. “That won’t work on me.”
Ai sighed dramatically. “I suppose you have a point… after all, a true genius wouldn’t back down from a challenge…”
Kazama twitched. “I—Wait. That’s—”
Ai leaned in, her voice honey-sweet. “Think of it, Kazama. You’d have the perfect resume. You’d get into any university you want. You’d finally have the power to create the ideal academic system.”
Kazama’s glasses slipped slightly down his nose. “...Ideal academic system?”
Ai smirked. Got him.
Shinchan grinned. “Uh-oh. Kazama’s about to sell his soul.”
Masao gulped. “Ai-chan is terrifying.”
Nene nodded. “And it’s beautiful.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Respect.”
Kazama grumbled. “Fine! I’ll consider it. But I still think this whole thing is doomed to fail.”
Ai clasped her hands together. “Yay! Now, we just have to make sure Shin-chan actually wins.”
Shinchan tilted his head. “Wait, there’s an election for this, right?”
Ai nodded. “Yes, but don’t worry—I have a plan.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “...Why does that sound dangerous?”
Kazama groaned. “Because it is.”

Chapter 24: The Art of Subtle Hype and Unexpected Encounters
The school halls were buzzing with energy as students moved between classes. The news of the upcoming student council elections had already started spreading, and amidst the conversations about potential candidates, something unusual was happening—Shinnosuke Nohara’s name was being thrown into the mix.
Not in an official capacity, not yet. But in passing conversations, in casual remarks, in little interactions that seemed too coincidental to be ignored.
It had begun.
The Unintentional-Intentional Campaign
“Man, I wish the school events were more fun,” a second-year student sighed in the hallway.
“Oh? You know who’d probably shake things up? Shin-chan,” Nene remarked casually, loud enough for others to overhear but not in a way that felt deliberate.
A nearby group of students perked up. “Huh? You mean that Nohara?”
Nene shrugged. “Well, he’s always coming up with crazy ideas, and let’s be honest, student council stuff gets kind of dull sometimes. Imagine how entertaining things would be with him around.”
The students exchanged thoughtful glances.
Elsewhere, Ai was subtly laying the groundwork in a different way.
“Oh no, I forgot my notebook at home,” a first-year girl groaned.
Before Ai could respond, Shinchan, who had been munching on a melon bread nearby, lazily reached into his bag and pulled out an extra notebook. “Here. You can borrow it.”
The girl’s eyes widened. “Oh! Thanks, Senpai!”
Ai clasped her hands together. “My, Shin-chan, you’re so kind and prepared. Always thinking ahead, huh?”
Shinchan gave her a side glance. “Uh-huh.” He wasn’t sure what game she was playing, but he was too busy enjoying his snack to care.
Still, the first-year girl and her friends whispered amongst themselves as they walked away. “I never realized Nohara-senpai was like that…”
It wasn’t just one moment.
Masao “accidentally” mentioned during PE that Shinchan had some of the fastest reflexes in the class.
Bo-chan casually pointed out that Shinchan was one of the few students who could balance schoolwork and still have time to mess around.
Kazama, begrudgingly caught in Ai’s schemes, subtly slipped into conversations that despite appearances, Shinchan was actually incredibly sharp—something that slowly started shifting perceptions among those who thought he was just a class clown.
Little by little, a reputation was being built. A campaign that wasn’t forcing his image onto anyone, but instead planting the seeds of curiosity.
And at the center of it all, Shinchan himself remained blissfully unaware.
An Unexpected Meeting
Later that evening, after school had ended and the unofficial campaign had left its first few ripples, Shinchan found himself lazily strolling home, hands in his pockets.
The sunset painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, casting long shadows over the quiet neighborhood. As he turned a familiar street corner, his eyes landed on a small, traditional dojo.
He hadn’t been here in years.
And standing right outside, locking up the entrance, was a man Shinchan hadn’t seen since kindergarten.
Hitoshi Takasugi.
His old kendo instructor.
Takasugi-sensei was an older man in his late fifties, with sharp yet kind eyes and a stance that even in casual clothes screamed “veteran.” Despite his age, his physique remained strong, and his presence commanded respect.
For a second, Shinchan debated walking past without saying anything. But before he could make up his mind, Takasugi-sensei turned—and their eyes met.
There was a pause before the older man blinked in recognition.
“...Shinnosuke?”
Shinchan sighed, stuffing his hands deeper into his pockets. “Yo.”
Takasugi chuckled. “I didn’t expect to run into you here. It’s been a long time.”
“Yeah, been a while.”
The sensei studied him carefully. “You’ve grown. But you still carry yourself the same way.”
Shinchan smirked. “That a compliment or an insult?”
Takasugi laughed. “Both.”
Shinchan chuckled but didn’t deny it.
There was a beat of silence before Takasugi spoke again. “I heard you stopped kendo after kindergarten.”
Shinchan’s smirk faltered slightly. “Yeah.”
Takasugi crossed his arms. “Shame. You had talent.”
Shinchan exhaled through his nose. “Lot of people say that.”
“Because it’s true.” The older man’s voice was steady. “And yet, you quit. I’ve always wondered why.”
Shinchan looked away, watching the wind rustle the trees.
Takasugi didn’t push, but he didn’t look away either.
After a moment, Shinchan finally muttered, “Just didn’t feel like it anymore.”
It was an answer, but not the full truth.
Takasugi hummed in thought. “Is that so?”
Shinchan shrugged.
Another pause, then the older man changed the subject. “And yet, I heard you showed up at a dojo recently.”
Shinchan’s eyebrow twitched. News spreads fast, huh?
He sighed. “That was just a one-time thing.”
Takasugi smirked. “Was it?”
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. “...What are you trying to say, old man?”
Takasugi shook his head with an amused chuckle. “Nothing. Just that people who truly don’t care about something don’t get drawn back to it so easily.”
Shinchan clicked his tongue. “Tch. You sound like Kazama.”
“Smart kid, then.”
Shinchan rolled his eyes.
Takasugi turned back to lock the dojo door, then glanced at Shinchan one last time. “If you ever decide to take kendo seriously again… this place is always open.”
Shinchan exhaled. “Noted.”
Takasugi gave him a small nod before walking off, leaving Shinchan alone in front of the dojo.
He stood there for a moment, staring at the place, the memories flickering at the edges of his mind.
Then, with a shake of his head, he stuffed his hands back into his pockets and continued walking home.
Kendo, huh?
It wasn’t his thing anymore.
Right?

Chapter 25: The Big Brother's Secret Plan
Shinchan woke up that morning with an odd feeling—like he had forgotten something important. He scratched his head, still half-asleep, as he sluggishly dragged himself to the bathroom.
Then, while brushing his teeth, it hit him.
Himawari’s birthday is next week.
Foam dribbled from his mouth as his eyes widened slightly. He wiped his chin and leaned against the sink, staring at his reflection.
Right. She was turning thirteen. His little sister wasn’t so little anymore.
He knew she’d probably already told their parents about what she wanted, but Shinchan couldn’t just sit back and do nothing for her birthday. He had to do something special.
But what?
That question hung over him the entire morning.
A Puzzled Shinchan is a Dangerous Thing
At school, his usual carefree, lazy demeanor was replaced by an uncharacteristic silence. Instead of cracking jokes or teasing Kazama, he rested his chin on his hand, his eyes slightly narrowed as he stared into space.
Kazama, Nene, Masao, Bo-chan, and Ai all exchanged glances.
“...What’s with him?” Nene asked, whispering to Ai.
Ai smirked. “Could it be? Has the great Shin-chan finally fallen for me and is now deep in thought, trying to figure out how to confess?”
Masao and Bo-chan looked skeptical.
“Yeah, no,” Masao deadpanned.
Kazama, on the other hand, adjusted his glasses, watching Shinchan closely.
“He’s probably thinking about something important,” Kazama muttered.
“Shinchan? Thinking?” Nene raised an eyebrow. “Unbelievable.”
But Kazama had seen this before. It wasn’t often, but when Shinchan cared about something, he really thought it through.
Before the others could speculate further, Ai leaned forward and poked Shinchan’s forehead.
“Shin-chan~ what’s on your mind?”
Shinchan blinked, snapping out of his thoughts. He looked at them, then sighed, rubbing the back of his head.
“Himawari’s birthday is next week,” he said simply.
The group stared.
“That’s it?” Masao tilted his head.
“Well, yeah.” Shinchan shrugged. “I wanna surprise her or something.”
There was a brief silence before Nene burst out laughing.
“Wait—you’re planning something thoughtful for your sister?”
Shinchan gave her a side glance. “You think I don’t care about her or something?”
“Well, you do spend half your life annoying her,” Nene pointed out.
“That’s what big brothers do,” Shinchan argued.
Ai, meanwhile, was just watching him with a knowing smile.
Kazama sighed, shaking his head. “You guys don’t get it. Shinchan always cares about Himawari. He just doesn’t show it in a normal way.”
Masao blinked. “Oh yeah… remember in elementary school when she lost that doll, and Shinchan secretly searched the whole neighborhood to find it?”
“Or when she got sick, and he tried to make her laugh by dancing around like an idiot?” Bo-chan added.
“Oi, I was being entertaining,” Shinchan huffed.
Nene looked thoughtful. “Huh. I guess you do care about her in your own weird way.”
Ai giggled. “How adorable~ A big brother planning something special for his little sister.”
Shinchan frowned. “Oi, don’t say it like that. You’re making it weird.”
Ai just smirked. “But it is cute~”
Kazama ignored them and adjusted his glasses. “So, what’s the plan? A surprise party?”
Shinchan leaned back in his chair. “Dunno yet. That’s what I was thinking about.”
Nene clapped her hands together. “Well, let’s plan something big, then! A birthday party for your sister should be fun, right?”
Masao looked unsure. “Won’t she get suspicious if we start acting weird?”
Shinchan exhaled. “Yeah, we gotta be sneaky about it. If she finds out, the surprise part is ruined.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Then we should split up the tasks.”
Kazama pulled out his notebook. “Alright. First, where do we want to have the party?”
The Party Planning Begins
They huddled together, whispering like they were plotting a grand heist.
“Location?” Kazama repeated.
“Could do it at my house,” Shinchan suggested. “But she might catch on.”
“What about one of those party venues?” Nene offered.
“Too expensive,” Kazama shook his head. “We should keep it somewhere familiar but unexpected.”
Ai tapped her chin in thought. “Oh! What about our old kindergarten?”
Shinchan blinked. “That’s… actually not a bad idea.”
“Right? It’d be nostalgic! Plus, Himawari wouldn’t expect it.”
The group nodded in agreement.
“Alright, next—guest list,” Kazama continued. “Aside from us, obviously.”
“Himawari’s friends from middle school,” Masao suggested.
“And don’t forget her childhood friends,” Ai reminded them. “Like the one she met when you guys moved for a while.”
“Oh, and Honda Keiko’s son!” Nene added. “He’s about Himawari’s age, right?”
Kazama noted down the names. “Alright, that should be good.”
“Now, gifts,” Masao said. “We all need to get her something.”
“Something sparkly,” Ai said.
“Something useful,” Kazama argued.
“Something cute,” Nene added.
Shinchan rubbed his chin. “Something that’ll make her go ‘KYAAA~!’”
The group deadpanned.
“What?”
“That’s… surprisingly accurate,” Ai admitted.
They assigned each person a role—Kazama would handle logistics, Ai would secure the venue, Nene and Masao would coordinate decorations, Bo-chan would handle food, and Shinchan would be in charge of keeping Himawari distracted.
“Alright,” Kazama said, closing his notebook. “We have six days to pull this off. Let’s not mess it up.”
Shinchan cracked his knuckles. “Piece of cake.”
Ai grinned. “Then let the operation Surprise Himawari begin~!”
And thus, the planning was officially underway.

next chapter 26 things are progressing nicely, also show some scenes of his home too.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 26: The Calm Before the Chaos
The plan was in motion, and things were progressing surprisingly well.
Too well.
Shinchan had a bad feeling about it.
Not that he wasn’t happy about how smoothly things were going—Himawari hadn’t caught on yet, and everyone was handling their roles perfectly. But when things went this smoothly, it usually meant that something was bound to go wrong.
Still, he put those thoughts aside as he made his way home, hands in his pockets, whistling a tune.
The sun was beginning to set, casting an orange glow over the neighborhood. He could already smell dinner cooking from a few houses away. When he finally reached his own home, he was greeted by the familiar sound of yelling.
“WHY ARE YOU WEARING MY NECKLACE?!”
Shinchan barely had time to react before his sister came charging down the hallway, eyes blazing.
“Hm?” He blinked, looking at her carefully. “I’m not.”
“I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU!”
Misae appeared in the hallway, arms crossed, watching the chaos unfold.
“Himawari, calm down,” she sighed. “It’s just a necklace.”
“‘Just a necklace’?! That’s my precious limited-edition jewelry from Falling Stars! I saved up my allowance for months for that!”
“Eh?” Shinchan peered over Himawari’s shoulder, finally noticing Shiro sitting near the couch, chewing on a very expensive-looking necklace.
Himawari nearly collapsed on the spot.
“...SHIROOOO!!”
The dog yelped and darted off before she could grab him.
Shinchan snorted. “Damn. Tough luck.”
“Tough luck?! This is a disaster!”
Misae sighed. “That’s what happens when you leave your things lying around.”
Himawari groaned. “Ughhh… I need to find a way to fix this before my birthday…”
Shinchan’s ears perked up.
Perfect. She’s distracted.
He made a mental note to accidentally give Shiro extra treats later before heading toward the dining table, where Hiroshi was already flipping through a magazine, seemingly oblivious to the chaos.
“Yo, Pops,” Shinchan greeted, plopping down in his seat.
Hiroshi grunted in response, not looking up.
“Long day?”
“Every day is a long day,” Hiroshi muttered, finally setting his magazine aside. He stretched, groaning. “Man, work’s been draining lately.”
“Maybe you should quit.”
“I’d love to, but we kind of need money to live.”
Shinchan chuckled. “Fair point.”
Misae walked over with a tray, setting down dinner—grilled fish, rice, and miso soup.
“Eat up before it gets cold,” she said.
As they dug in, Hiroshi glanced at Shinchan. “So, what’s with you? You’ve been acting kinda weird lately.”
Shinchan paused mid-bite. “Huh?”
“You’ve been unusually quiet. Not getting into trouble as much. It’s suspicious.”
Misae narrowed her eyes. “...You’re not failing any subjects, are you?”
Shinchan nearly choked.
“Pfft—what? No! I just aced my exams, remember?”
“Oh right,” Hiroshi nodded. “Still doesn’t explain why you’re acting so thoughtful. It’s creepy.”
Shinchan sighed. “Jeez, can’t a guy think about something without being interrogated?”
Misae smirked. “Not when that guy is you.”
“Fair.”
Himawari finally joined them at the table, grumbling under her breath about Shiro. Shinchan kept his expression neutral. If she suspected anything about the surprise, it’d all go up in flames.
For now, though, everything was still going according to plan.
The Progress Report
The next day at school, Shinchan and the group gathered in their usual spot.
“So, how’s everything coming along?” Kazama asked, flipping through his notebook.
Ai beamed. “The venue is secured~ I talked to the kindergarten’s administration, and they said we could use the place for the party, as long as we clean up after.”
Nene grinned. “Decorations are also ready! Masao and I found some really cute ones.”
Masao nodded. “We just need to set them up on the day of the party.”
Bo-chan gave a thumbs-up. “The food is being prepared by a caterer my family knows.”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Perfect. And what about the guest list?”
“Everyone’s confirmed,” Ai said proudly. “Her middle school friends, her childhood friends, even the son of Honda Keiko. It’s going to be amazing.”
Shinchan smirked. “Man, we’re way too good at this.”
“Don’t get cocky,” Kazama warned. “We still have to execute everything without her finding out.”
Ai giggled. “But with me in charge, how could anything go wrong?”
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. “That’s exactly how things go wrong.”
Ai pouted. “Rude.”
Still, things were going smoothly, and with just a few days left, they just needed to hold it together until the big day.
Easier said than done.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 27: The Day of Action
The day had finally arrived.
The ultimate Himawari Birthday Surprise Operation™ was in full swing.
Shinchan woke up earlier than usual—a rare sight in the Nohara household. Misae nearly dropped her frying pan when she saw him shuffling into the kitchen without being dragged out of bed first.
“You’re up… early?” she said, narrowing her eyes.
“Mm,” Shinchan hummed, rubbing his eyes. “Couldn’t sleep.”
Himawari, sitting at the table with a piece of toast in her mouth, raised an eyebrow. “That’s suspicious.”
Shinchan plastered on his best innocent look. “What? Can’t I just wake up early for once?”
“No,” both Misae and Himawari deadpanned.
He clicked his tongue. Tch. Too sharp.
But before Himawari could press further, Hiroshi strolled in, yawning. “Ugh… Why’s everyone awake so early? It’s Sunday…”
Misae rolled her eyes. “Some of us have responsibilities.”
Himawari huffed. “And some of us just got rudely woken up by a certain idiot sleep-talking too loud.”
Shinchan snickered. “What was I saying? Lemme guess—‘Ai-chan, don’t stop, keep going~’?”
Himawari gagged. “EW. NO.”
Misae smacked the back of his head. “Stop saying weird things in the morning!”
After breakfast, the Noharas went about their day as usual, with Himawari completely unaware that the rest of them had a very different agenda.

Phase One: The Bait
At precisely 11:00 AM, Kazama called Himawari, his voice carefully casual.
“Hey, Himawari, are you busy?”
“Hm? Not really, why?”
“Could you come with me to the bookstore? I need help picking out a birthday present for my cousin.”
Himawari’s ego immediately flared up. “Ohh? So you need my expertise?”
Kazama forced a chuckle. “Yeah… sure. Let’s go with that.”
Himawari smirked. “Alright, I’ll be there in ten.”
With that, the bait had been taken.
“Hook, line, and sinker,” Kazama muttered after hanging up. He turned to the others. “Alright. We have about an hour before she starts getting suspicious. Let’s move.”

Phase Two: The Setup
The venue was the kindergarten they all used to attend—a place of nostalgia, where Himawari had also spent a few years before moving on to middle school.
As Shinchan walked through the gates, memories hit him like a truck.
“…Whoa.”
He hadn’t been here in years, but it still looked the same. The colorful play structures, the familiar smell of grass and crayons, the tiny little chairs that felt way too small for him now.
He turned to the others. “Man, this feels weird.”
Ai smiled. “Right? It’s like we’re time-traveling.”
Nene giggled. “I feel like we should be wearing those little yellow hats again.”
Masao shivered. “Please don’t remind me. I used to cry every morning when I got dropped off here.”
Kazama snorted. “You still cry when things get tough.”
“HEY!”
Bo-chan hummed, placing a banner over the main hall entrance. “This should do.”
They had gone all out with the decorations—colorful streamers, fairy lights, and banners that read Happy Birthday, Himawari! in huge, glittery letters. The tables were lined with food, gifts stacked neatly in the corner, and a birthday cake that could make anyone’s mouth water.
“Ohh~ This looks amazing,” Ai said, clapping her hands together. “She’s going to love it!”
Shinchan smirked. “Assuming she doesn’t kill us first.”

Phase Three: The Execution
Kazama’s job was to stall Himawari.
Which was proving to be difficult.
“Why is it taking you this long to pick a book?” Himawari groaned, crossing her arms.
Kazama, sweating, picked up a random book and examined it as if it held the meaning of life. “I just need to make sure I get the right one.”
“You’re overthinking this,” she deadpanned. “Just pick one and go.”
“…Fine,” he muttered. Time to initiate the backup stalling plan.
As they walked out of the bookstore, Kazama suddenly smirked. “Oh, by the way… do you know what your brother has been up to lately?”
Himawari blinked. “Huh?”
“I heard some rumors,” Kazama said, pretending to be deep in thought. “Something about him changing since Ai-chan came back.”
Himawari’s eyes narrowed. “What are you talking about?”
Kazama shrugged. “You know, being more serious, more focused…” He leaned in slightly. “More romantic.”
Himawari recoiled. “EW! STOP.”
Kazama grinned. “I mean, think about it. He wakes up early now. He’s been deep in thought. You don’t think it has anything to do with Ai-chan?”
“…Ugh, I hate that you’re making me consider this.”
Kazama smirked. “Exactly.”
As expected, Himawari was too busy overanalyzing that statement to notice they were conveniently heading toward the kindergarten.
And when she stepped inside—
“SURPRIIIIIIISE!!!”
Himawari froze.
Her eyes darted around the room, taking in the decorations, the cake, the guests—including her middle school friends and even Honda Keiko’s son.
Then, finally, she turned to her brother.
Shinchan grinned. “Happy Birthday, Hima.”
For the first time ever, Himawari was speechless.
“…You guys…”
She looked at everyone—their excited faces, the sheer effort put into making this day special for her.
Then she took a deep breath.
And burst into tears.
“H-Hey, wait, I wasn’t ready for this,” Shinchan muttered, panicking.
“I TOLD YOU SHE’D CRY,” Masao whispered.
Himawari wiped her eyes furiously. “I’m not crying!! It’s just… dust!!”
Ai giggled. “Of course, of course.”
Shinchan scratched his cheek, looking away. “You like it?”
Himawari sniffled, then beamed.
“I LOVE IT!!”
And just like that, the chaos began.

The Aftermath
The party was a huge success.
There was food, games, and Himawari’s competitive spirit in full force as she dragged people into various contests. At one point, she even managed to obliterate Kazama in a trivia game, much to his dismay.
As the evening wound down, she sat next to Shinchan, holding her pile of gifts.
“Thanks, Niichan.”
Shinchan stretched. “Heh. No big deal.”
“No, seriously,” she said, looking at him. “This was… the best birthday ever.”
Shinchan blinked, then smirked. “Damn right it was.”
She rolled her eyes but smiled.
And with that, the Himawari Birthday Surprise Operation™ was a mission complete.

Chapter 27 (Continued): Nostalgia and Unspoken Words
The party had ended, and now came the part everyone conveniently forgot about—cleaning up.
Masao groaned, stretching his arms. “Man, I’m exhausted. Can’t we just leave the decorations and call it ‘modern art’?”
Kazama scoffed. “Yeah, sure. And when the kindergarten teachers find this mess tomorrow morning, they’ll definitely appreciate the ‘artistic expression’.”
Bo-chan hummed, stacking chairs like an absolute pro. “We should finish before it gets too late.”
Shinchan yawned, tossing paper cups into a trash bag. “Bo’s right. The faster we move, the sooner we can go home and sleep.”
Himawari, still on her birthday high, was floating around the room, smiling at the decorations. “I don’t want to take this down yet… it’s too pretty.”
“Sorry, princess,” Nene teased, “but unless you want to sneak into kindergarten every day to admire it, we have to clean up.”
As everyone worked, the atmosphere felt… different.
The nostalgia of being back here—the memories of their kindergarten days—mixed with the warmth of the party, leaving a strange, almost sentimental air in the room.
At one point, Ai picked up a small, old wooden block from the corner. She ran her fingers over the carved-out letters, then turned to Shinchan with a soft smile.
“…You carved this, didn’t you?”
Shinchan blinked. “Huh?”
She held it up—there, etched in rough, clumsy letters, were the words Shinchan wuz here.
He snorted. “Oh, damn. That takes me back.”
Ai laughed. “I remember! You got caught, and instead of feeling guilty, you just went, ‘Well, now everyone will know I was here forever.’”
Shinchan grinned. “No regrets.”
Ai shook her head, still smiling, but there was a gentleness in her eyes now.
The others, caught up in their own conversations, didn’t notice when Shinchan and Ai quietly slipped outside.

The evening air was cool, the sky fading into deep shades of orange and purple. The faint sounds of their friends cleaning up echoed from inside, but out here, it was peaceful.
Shinchan stretched, letting out a content sigh. “Man… I almost forgot how much fun birthdays could be.”
Ai leaned against the railing, watching him. “…You really care about her, don’t you?”
He glanced at her. “Who, Hima?”
She nodded.
Shinchan chuckled. “Well, yeah. She’s my little sister. If I don’t look out for her, who will?”
Ai tilted her head. “You know… people don’t always see this side of you.”
“What side?”
“This side.” She gestured vaguely. “The one that actually thinks things through. The one that cares.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Ouch. You’re making it sound like I’m heartless most of the time.”
Ai giggled. “No, but… I think you like letting people underestimate you.”
He smirked. “Makes life more entertaining.”
She shook her head, then sighed, hugging herself slightly. “Honestly… I kinda wish we had more moments like this.”
Shinchan blinked. “Like what?”
“Just… talking. Without you cracking some weird joke or trying to get a reaction out of me.”
Shinchan stared at her for a second, then smirked. “Oh, so you do like talking to me.”
Ai groaned. “Ugh, and there goes the moment.”
He laughed, leaning back against the railing.
But as the laughter faded, a comfortable silence settled between them.
The dim glow of the kindergarten’s outdoor lights cast soft shadows, and Ai’s expression grew almost… wistful.
“Back then,” she murmured, “when I had to leave… I was scared you’d forget me.”
Shinchan glanced at her. “Huh?”
“I mean, we were kids. I thought maybe I was just one of the many people you’d meet and forget over time.”
Shinchan frowned slightly. “That’s dumb.”
Ai blinked. “Excuse me?”
“I mean, come on,” he said, stuffing his hands in his pockets. “You? Forgettable? That’s gotta be the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Ai stared at him.
For once, he wasn’t joking.
There was no teasing lilt in his voice, no smug grin on his face. Just a simple, straightforward statement—like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Her heart did an annoying little thump.
“…You’re unfair,” she muttered.
Shinchan blinked. “Hah?”
She turned away, crossing her arms. “You’re just… really unfair sometimes.”
He tilted his head. “Elaborate.”
“No.”
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. “…Are you flustered right now?”
Ai scoffed. “Pfft. As if.”
A smirk slowly crept onto his face. “Ohhh. You totally are.”
“I am not.”
“Admit it.”
“No.”
“I can see your ears turning red.”
Ai gasped dramatically, covering her ears. “Lies! Slander!”
Shinchan laughed, shoving his hands deeper into his pockets. “Damn. And you were so close to getting me flustered earlier, too.”
Ai pouted, then huffed. “…Fine. But next time, I’ll win.”
Shinchan grinned. “Sure. You keep telling yourself that.”
And as the last of the evening light faded, the two of them stood there a little longer—bickering, teasing, but somehow… closer than before.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 28: The Race for Student Council Begins
The bell rang, signaling the end of the last period, but today, no one rushed out of their seats. Instead, murmurs filled the classroom, and scattered whispers traveled from desk to desk like an underground information network.
“Did you hear?”
“Someone else is running for Student Council President.”
“Wait, what? Who?”
“Apparently, they made a bold announcement today. It’s gonna be a real competition now.”
Ai, sitting beside Shinchan, tapped her fingers against her desk, her expression unreadable. The progress she had been making in her campaign to casually push Shinchan’s reputation upward was finally bearing fruit. His name had started floating around as a candidate, but now—
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “This is bad.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Is it?”
“Yes!” Kazama’s voice dropped to a whisper. “If there’s an actual competitor, that means this isn’t just an easy push anymore. We have to take this more seriously!”
Masao, sweating already, nodded. “Yeah! If it was just a natural momentum thing, people would’ve slowly accepted Shinchan as the best choice. But if there’s a rivalry—”
Nene smirked. “Then we need to actually fight for the spot.”
Ai sat back, crossing her arms. “This isn’t a problem. It’s an opportunity.”
Bo-chan, who had been quietly listening, finally spoke. “Who’s the rival?”
Everyone blinked.
Right. No one actually knew who had declared war on Shinchan’s unofficial campaign.
At that moment, the classroom door slid open dramatically.
“Shin Nohara!”
A loud, confident voice echoed across the room. Everyone turned toward the entrance, and standing there, radiating an aura of absolute authority, was—
“Yonro?” Shinchan blinked, completely caught off guard.
The former kindergarten teacher’s pet, the poster boy for overly enthusiastic student behavior, and the only person in the world who could make Kazama look like a slacker was standing there… and pointing directly at Shinchan.
“I knew it was you!” Yonro declared. “I’ve heard the rumors! You, of all people, running for Student Council President?!”
Shinchan scratched his head. “Uh, first of all, I never said I was running.”
Yonro ignored him completely. “There is no way I can allow this! If you’re running, then so am I!”
Ai’s eye twitched. This… this was the competition?
Nene stifled a laugh. Masao looked terrified. Kazama had his face buried in his hands.
Bo-chan, ever the calm one, simply nodded. “Interesting.”
Shinchan sighed, standing up. “Yonro, buddy, listen—”
“No!” Yonro slammed his fist against the wall, his eyes shining with the passion of a thousand motivational speeches. “This school needs a strong leader! Someone who understands discipline! Someone who values order! Someone who—”
Shinchan deadpanned. “Bro, this is a high school student council, not the military.”
Yonro gasped. “And that attitude is why I must stop you! I will become president!”
Shinchan groaned, rubbing his temples. “I literally didn’t even say I was running.”
Ai smirked. “Oh, but you are.”
He turned to her. “Since when?”
“Since I decided,” she said sweetly.
Yonro clenched his fist. “Then it’s settled. You are my opponent, Shin Nohara!”
The entire class erupted into whispers.
Shinchan sighed. “Man… I was hoping for a peaceful high school life.”
Kazama, still hiding his face, muttered, “You never had a chance at that.”

Campaign Mode: Activated
The moment Yonro declared himself as an opponent, things escalated.
Students began forming unofficial ‘supporter’ groups, debates started happening in the hallways, and before Shinchan even realized it, posters were being put up.
Yonro for President!
 A brighter future with discipline!
And then—
Vote Shinchan! Because why not?
 Less stress, more fun!
Shinchan stared at the posters Ai had designed. “That’s our slogan?”
Ai winked. “It fits you.”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Actually, it does. It perfectly contrasts Yonro’s strict image.”
Nene grinned. “This is turning into a real election.”
Bo-chan nodded. “We need a campaign strategy.”
Masao wiped his sweat. “Why does this feel like a war?”

Yonro’s First Move
As expected, Yonro wasted no time.
The next morning, he was standing at the school entrance, personally greeting students.
“Good morning! Have a wonderful and productive day!”
Ai narrowed her eyes. “Tch. He’s playing the ‘friendly leader’ card.”
Shinchan yawned. “And?”
“We need to counter it,” she said seriously.
Nene leaned in. “You could try greeting people too.”
Shinchan made a face. “Ugh. Sounds like effort.”
Kazama sighed. “You are going to have to do something, you know.”
Bo-chan hummed. “Or we could try a different approach.”
Ai’s eyes gleamed. “I like where this is going.”

The Shinchan Way
Instead of standing at the front and greeting people formally, Shinchan did what he always did.
By lunchtime, he was lounging in the courtyard, cracking jokes, playfully annoying his friends, and just being himself.
And yet…
Students naturally gravitated toward him.
People liked being around him. He wasn’t strict like Yonro. He wasn’t forcing discipline or responsibility on anyone.
He was just… fun.
Ai smirked. “Perfect.”
Masao tilted his head. “Wait, what are we doing?”
Ai folded her arms. “We’re letting Shinchan be Shinchan. People already like him. If they see him as the easy-going, approachable option, he’ll win votes naturally.”
Kazama blinked. “…That’s actually genius.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Effortless campaigning.”
Nene grinned. “I like it.”
Masao sighed in relief. “So I don’t have to do anything extreme?”
Ai smiled. “Nope.”
Masao cheered.
Kazama pushed up his glasses. “But we’ll need a plan for when Yonro starts actually campaigning.”
Ai’s smirk widened. “Oh, don’t worry. I’ve already thought of that.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Should I be scared?”
“Yes,” Ai said simply.
And as the ‘campaign war’ continued to escalate, Shinchan realized that, like it or not…
He was officially in the race for Student Council President.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 29: War of Words
The classroom atmosphere was tense.
By now, the school had split into two distinct camps—those supporting Shinchan’s laid-back, natural charisma and those rallying behind Yonro’s disciplined, hardworking leadership.
The War for the Student Council Throne had officially escalated.
And so, after an increasing number of hallway debates, loud lunchroom arguments, and even a dramatic confrontation in front of the vending machines (“Shinchan wouldn’t even enforce rules!”—“Yeah? At least he wouldn’t ban afternoon naps!”), the teachers decided to intervene.
A live debate was scheduled.
One week from now.
Both candidates.
One stage.
No escape.

Breaking the News
“You’re what?!”
Shinchan yawned. “They said I have to debate Yonro next week.”
Ai slammed her hands on the desk. “This is perfect.”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Actually, this is terrible. We need a proper speech. We need structure. We need—”
“We need Shinchan to actually care,” Masao finished.
Nene sighed dramatically. “Oh, come on, we’ve been working so hard! If we win this debate, the election is ours!”
Shinchan tilted his head. “Or I could just lose on purpose and be done with this.”
Silence.
Ai slowly turned toward him, her expression unreadable.
Then she smiled.
Sweetly.
A little too sweetly.
“I see.”
Shinchan blinked.
And then Ai grabbed his collar, pulling him dangerously close. “Nohara Shin-chan, you are going to stand on that stage and give the greatest speech this school has ever seen, or so help me—”
Kazama coughed. “Ahem. Violence won’t solve this.”
Ai let go, sighing. “Fine. But we do need to get serious.”
Bo-chan, who had been silent, nodded. “Agreed.”
Shinchan sighed, stretching. “Fine, fine. What do we do?”

The Yonro Problem
Yonro, unsurprisingly, had already started preparing.
Rumors spread that he was writing an essay-length speech on why the school needed proper discipline. He had secured a practice debate with the seniors.
There was even talk of a power stance he was working on.
“He’s going all out,” Kazama said, scanning the notes they had gathered. “We can’t afford to be careless.”
Masao groaned. “We’re so gonna lose.”
Shinchan laughed. “Oh man, this is getting hilarious.”
Nene crossed her arms. “It won’t be hilarious if we get crushed.”
Ai, tapping her chin, smirked. “No. We can win.”
Everyone turned to her.
“How?” Kazama asked.
“By doing exactly what we’ve been doing all along.”
She pointed at Shinchan.
“This guy’s greatest strength isn’t fancy words. It’s his ability to connect with people naturally. So instead of a formal speech—”
“We make it a show,” Nene finished, eyes sparkling.
Bo-chan hummed in approval. “Something memorable.”
Kazama hesitated. “But a debate is supposed to be structured—”
Ai cut him off. “Not if we make our own rules.”
Shinchan chuckled. “Now this I can work with.”
And just like that, preparations for the most chaotic student council debate in history had begun.

Yonro’s Training Arc (???)
Meanwhile, on the other side of the school…
“Stand straight, speak from the diaphragm, and believe in yourself!”
Yonro was training like a shounen protagonist.
Surrounded by a group of devoted followers, he practiced his speech in the mirror, perfected his tone, and even did vocal warm-ups.
“This school deserves a leader who will shape it into a model of efficiency! Ahem! Again!”
His friends cheered. “President Yonro! President Yonro!”
He adjusted his tie, looking into the mirror.
“…I will win.”

The Countdown Begins
With only six days left, the battlefield had been set.
On one side, the strict and disciplined Yonro, preparing like a military commander.
On the other, the chaotic yet strangely powerful force that was Shinchan and his group, scheming up the most unexpected debate strategy possible.
One week.
One stage.
No rules.
And so, the student council race reached its boiling point.

Chapter 30: A Quiet Conversation
The school was unusually quiet in the late afternoon.
With the student council election reaching its peak, most of the students were either caught up in debate preparations or in their own after-school activities. The hallways, which were usually bustling with noise, had a certain calm to them.
Shinchan leaned against the railing of the rooftop, gazing at the sky. The sun was beginning to set, casting an orange glow over the campus. Beside him, Kazama stood with his arms crossed, sipping from a juice box.
For a few minutes, neither of them spoke.
Then, Kazama broke the silence.
“You’re actually thinking about it, aren’t you?”
Shinchan blinked. “Thinking about what?”
Kazama gave him a side glance. “This whole election thing.”
Shinchan chuckled. “I mean… a little, maybe.”
Kazama smirked. “That’s a lot coming from you.”
Shinchan stretched his arms above his head. “What can I say? Everyone’s so into it. Feels like a waste to just throw it.”
Kazama nodded, sipping his juice again. “I see.”
Shinchan turned his head toward him. “What about you? You’ve been helping all this time, but I know you’re the type who’d rather run for president yourself.”
Kazama exhaled, shaking his head. “You’re not wrong. I did consider it.”
Shinchan smirked. “Then why didn’t you?”
Kazama hesitated for a moment. Then, with a small smile, he replied, “Because I realized something.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow.
Kazama continued, “I’d be a good student council president. You? You’d be a great one.”
Shinchan let out a small laugh. “Now that’s the biggest joke I’ve heard all day.”
Kazama shook his head. “I’m serious. You don’t try to be a leader, but people naturally follow you. Even if you act like you don’t care, you’re the kind of person who makes things fun just by being there.” He paused. “And when it really matters… you’re always there for us.”
Shinchan scratched the back of his head. “Man, that’s a lot of pressure. Now I have to try.”
Kazama smirked. “Good.”
A comfortable silence settled between them again.
Then, Kazama casually added, “Speaking of things you pretend not to care about… Ai-chan.”
Shinchan blinked. “Huh?”
Kazama shot him a knowing look. “She’s been pulling all kinds of ridiculous schemes to get your attention. Even the teachers have noticed.”
Shinchan sighed dramatically. “She really is dedicated to her cause.”
Kazama chuckled. “And yet, you’ve barely reacted to any of it.”
Shinchan shrugged. “What can I say? It’s fun watching her try.”
Kazama hummed. “So, if she stopped trying, would you be okay with that?”
Shinchan didn’t answer immediately.
For the first time since the whole election started, he actually took a moment to think.
“…I dunno,” he admitted, glancing away. “It’d be weird if she stopped. She’s always been like that, ever since kindergarten.”
Kazama smiled. “Then maybe it’s time you start giving her a reaction.”
Shinchan turned to look at him, slightly surprised.
Kazama finished his juice, tossing the empty box into a nearby trash can. “Just think about it.”
With that, he walked away, leaving Shinchan alone with his thoughts.
For the first time since Ai had returned, Shinchan actually considered what it would be like if she wasn’t chasing after him.
And for the first time…
He realized he might not like that.
As the sun continued to set, a small smirk crept onto his face.
Maybe…
Just maybe…
It was time for him to start trying too.

Chapter 31: The Day of the Debate
The entire school was abuzz with anticipation.
It was finally here—the student council election debate. Posters covered every inch of the hallway, rival supporters whispered strategies in the corridors, and teachers hovered nervously, half-expecting chaos to unfold.
And at the center of it all was…
Shinchan, lounging in his seat, spinning a pen between his fingers as if none of this concerned him.
Ai-chan, on the other hand, looked far too pleased.
"This is it," she said, clenching her fist in excitement. "The moment where we crush them with the brilliance of our campaign!"
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "It’s a debate, Ai-chan, not a battlefield."
"But it feels like a battlefield," Nene added, looking between the two teams sitting across the auditorium. "They’ve got a presence."
Masao gulped. "I heard their candidate is actually in the debate club. And that he's never lost."
Bo-chan nodded. "He once made a second-year cry."
"Man," Shinchan muttered, tapping his pen against the desk. "I sure hope it's not that serious."
"Shin-chan," Ai said sweetly, placing her hand on his shoulder. "Don't worry. If things go south, we’ll just turn to plan B."
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "Plan B?"
Ai smirked. "Charm them with your natural charisma, of course."
Kazama sighed. "That’s not a plan—that’s gambling."
Before they could argue further, the auditorium lights dimmed. The debate was about to begin.

Round One: Opening Statements
The rival team’s candidate, a tall and sharp-looking guy named Hayashi, walked up to the podium. His aura screamed seriousness.
"Leadership," he began, his voice firm. "Is not a game. It is not a joke. It is the responsibility to ensure the students of this school are given structure, discipline, and efficiency. Our team’s goal is to make this school better, by implementing practical policies and strict organization."
A round of applause erupted from the audience.
Kazama nodded. "That was a solid opening."
Then, it was Shinchan’s turn.
He slowly got up, stretching as he walked to the podium.
Then, with an easygoing smile, he said—
"School's important and all, but let’s be honest—if we’re not having fun, what’s the point?"
Silence.
Ai-chan nearly choked.
Kazama facepalmed.
Nene turned pale.
Masao whispered, "We’re doomed."
But then—
A wave of cheers erupted from the crowd.
"HE’S RIGHT!" a random student yelled.
"Finally someone who gets it!" another shouted.
Even some of the teachers looked like they wanted to nod.
Shinchan smirked. This is easier than I thought.
Hayashi, however, remained unfazed. "So your campaign strategy is… fun?"
Shinchan shrugged. "Not just fun. But let’s not pretend school life isn’t miserable when there’s too much pressure. We wanna make this place somewhere people actually like to be."
Ai-chan clapped a hand over her mouth. He’s actually making sense…
Kazama looked both proud and horrified.
"That wasn't our planned speech," he muttered.
Bo-chan simply said, "But it worked."

Round Two: Q&A
The moderator called for questions from the audience.
A girl from the debate club stood up. "Hayashi-kun, if you were president, how would you handle club funding?"
Hayashi nodded. "We would implement a strict budgeting plan, prioritizing academic clubs over leisure clubs to encourage better use of school resources."
A few students murmured in agreement.
Then, the same girl turned to Shinchan. "And you?"
Shinchan scratched his chin. "Well… I think all clubs are important, right? Everyone has something they love. Some people love science, some love music, some love, uh… bug collecting."
A single kid in the back cheered.
Shinchan continued, "So, I’d try to make sure every club gets a fair chance. No one should feel like their interests don’t matter just because they aren’t ‘academic.’ Otherwise, what’s the point of having clubs?"
The audience murmured again—this time with interest.
Ai-chan beamed. He's actually winning them over!
Hayashi narrowed his eyes. "That’s an unrealistic and impractical way of looking at it."
Shinchan tilted his head. "Is it? Or is it just more practical to let people enjoy their school life?"
Hayashi opened his mouth—then closed it.
For the first time, he had no response.
Ai nearly fell out of her chair.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "He… he actually cornered him."
Nene whispered, "Who is this man?"
Bo-chan nodded sagely. "Shinchan."
Masao just stared. "He’s been holding back this level of competence all along?"
Shinchan, meanwhile, casually returned to his seat, popping a candy in his mouth.
"Too easy."

Final Round: Closing Arguments
Hayashi stepped forward again.
"I understand that people want school to be enjoyable. But leadership is about responsibility. It’s about making difficult choices. Can we really trust someone who doesn’t take things seriously?"
Silence filled the auditorium.
It was a strong final statement.
Then, it was Shinchan’s turn.
He leaned against the podium, smirking. "I think you’ve got it backwards. Responsibility doesn’t mean making life miserable. It means making things better. If being president means making sure everyone enjoys their time here—"
He shrugged.
"Then yeah. I take that very seriously."
The crowd erupted.
Hayashi’s team visibly deflated.
The debate was over.

Aftermath
As they walked out of the auditorium, Ai was practically vibrating.
"Shin-chan," she said, clutching his sleeve. "That was perfect."
Shinchan yawned. "Eh, it was alright."
Kazama stared at him. "You… you were holding back this whole time."
Shinchan grinned. "Maybe."
Masao nearly collapsed. "We could’ve lost, and you just winged it!?"
Bo-chan simply nodded. "That was a bold move."
Ai-chan smirked. "Well, at this rate, there’s no way you won’t win the election."
Shinchan stretched. "Eh, we’ll see."
But deep down, he already knew—
The presidency was as good as his.

Chapter 32: Voting Day & The Aftermath
The day had finally arrived.
Voting day.
Students filed into the school’s main hall, ballots in hand, casting their votes as whispers and murmurs filled the air. Banners from both campaigns were still up, though at this point, there was little left to do but wait.
For Shinchan and his group, the election had been an exhausting journey. Countless days of strategizing, preparing speeches (which Shinchan promptly ignored), and promoting his campaign (often in questionable ways) had finally led to this moment.
And now, it was out of their hands.
—
The Aftermath: Resting at Shinchan’s House
After the voting concluded, the group made their way to Shinchan’s house, utterly drained from the past few weeks.
As they entered, Misae peeked out from the kitchen. "Oh? You’re all back early today."
"We’re done," Kazama sighed dramatically, dropping onto the couch like a lifeless ragdoll.
Nene collapsed next to him. "We’ve worked so hard… I feel like an old woman."
Masao nodded. "That was way more effort than I thought it’d be."
Bo-chan sat down without a word, already munching on a snack he had somehow acquired.
Meanwhile, Ai-chan was stretching, looking entirely too pleased. "Everything went perfectly in the end. Now, we just have to wait for the results."
Shinchan yawned and flopped onto the floor, arms stretched out. "Y’know, I almost don’t care about the results anymore. I just wanna sleep."
Misae raised an eyebrow. "Oh? That’s funny, considering you’ve been running around non-stop for the past few weeks."
"That’s ‘cause Ai-chan forced me to," Shinchan grumbled.
Ai-chan giggled. "You say that, but you didn’t exactly resist either."
Hiroshi, who had just walked in, gave his son an amused look. "So, it’s finally over, huh? Well, no matter what happens, you gave it your all."
Shinchan waved a hand lazily. "Yeah, yeah, words of wisdom, thanks, Dad."
Hiroshi just grinned. "Honestly, I’m more impressed you even tried. Never thought I’d see the day my son got involved in school politics."
Misae snorted. "It had to be Ai-chan dragging him into it."
Ai-chan smiled innocently. "I might have encouraged it, yes."
Shinchan rolled onto his stomach. "Well, we’ll know the results in three days. Until then, I refuse to move from this spot."
Kazama, still lying on the couch, groaned. "Agreed."
Nene nodded. "Same."
Masao was already half-asleep.
Bo-chan just took another bite of his snack.
And with that, the group fell into a comfortable silence, basking in the rare peace they had earned.
You said:
the grp tease shin chan of ai helping misae around as they hang around, they talk have fun they leaves for the day.
ChatGPT said:
As the group lounged around in the Nohara household, an unexpected but somehow very familiar sight caught their attention—Ai-chan was in the kitchen, casually helping Misae with the dishes.
The sight alone was enough to set off a chain reaction of teasing.
Kazama smirked. "Well, well, Shinchan, your future wife is already getting along with your mother."
Shinchan, still sprawled on the floor, barely lifted his head. "Huh?"
Nene giggled. "She’s already helping out around the house. That’s basically one step away from moving in!"
Masao clutched his stomach as he laughed. "S-Soon, she’ll start calling Misae-san ‘Okaa-san’!"
Bo-chan, with perfect comedic timing, added, "Misae-mama."
The group erupted into laughter.
Ai-chan, who had been listening the entire time, turned around and gave them all an innocent smile—one that definitely hid something mischievous underneath.
"Oh my," she said sweetly, "Are you all so enthusiastic about the idea? How adorable!"
Masao immediately choked on his own laughter.
Kazama coughed, looking away.
Nene pretended to check her phone, whistling casually.
Bo-chan… continued eating.
Shinchan sighed dramatically. "You guys are getting ahead of yourselves. Ai-chan is just buttering up my mom so she can get away with stuff."
Misae, overhearing this, flicked Shinchan on the forehead. "Excuse you, she’s a polite and helpful young lady."
Ai-chan beamed. "See? Misae-san appreciates me."
Shinchan just muttered under his breath, too lazy to fight back.
—
Eventually, after chatting, teasing, and just enjoying the post-election relief, the group started packing up to leave for the day.
Kazama stretched. "Welp, I’ll see you guys at school tomorrow. These three days are gonna feel long."
Nene sighed. "Yeah, but at least we can actually relax now."
Masao patted Shinchan’s shoulder. "Try not to lose sleep thinking about your beloved Ai-chan."
Shinchan kicked him lightly.
Ai-chan just smiled, waving. "See you all tomorrow~!"
As they stepped out the door, Misae leaned against the wall, watching them leave with an amused expression.
"You’ve got good friends," she said.
Shinchan yawned, leaning back. "Yeah, they’re alright."
Misae smirked. "Ai-chan, though…"
Shinchan groaned. "Not you too, Mom."
And with that, the day came to an end, leaving behind the anticipation of what was to come.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 33: The Longest Three Days
The wait was agonizing.
Three days had passed since the election, but to Shinchan and his group, it felt like three months.
Even though life at school continued as usual, there was an odd tension in the air. Students whispered about the elections in the hallways, some placing bets, others making up absurd rumors like Shinchan bribed the teachers with a lifetime supply of Chocobi.
The group did their best to act natural, but it was clear they were all on edge.
—
Day One:
Kazama tried to drown himself in studying to distract himself from the election, but he found himself staring blankly at a page in his textbook for 20 minutes.
"…This isn’t working."
Nene kept checking her phone, even though there were no updates.
Masao tried to meditate. He failed.
Bo-chan… was Bo-chan.
Ai-chan kept her usual composure but was strangely more talkative to Shinchan than usual, as if trying to test how much he was thinking about it.
And Shinchan?
He was completely fine.
Or so he claimed.
In reality, he was just as impatient as the rest of them, but his natural laziness helped him avoid overthinking it. Instead of worrying, he spent most of his free time annoying Kazama, which provided some much-needed entertainment for the others.
—
Day Two:
Kazama had lost his mind.
"I swear the teachers are taking their time on purpose!" he ranted as he paced around during lunch.
"What if there was a miscalculation? What if they miscounted the votes? What if—"
Shinchan placed a hand on his shoulder. "Kazama, buddy. You need a Chocobi."
Kazama looked at him with the eyes of a man who had seen the depths of madness. "That won’t fix this."
Ai giggled. "Oh? But if Shinchan fed it to you, I bet you’d calm down."
Kazama twitched. The others howled with laughter.
Meanwhile, Nene was scribbling in her notebook. "If I become the secretary, I’m going to make a very detailed schedule. No more last-minute announcements."
Masao nodded. "I just don’t wanna mess up my role. I feel like I already forgot what a treasurer does."
Shinchan patted his head. "It’s okay, Masao. Just smile and nod, and no one will know."
Masao didn’t find that reassuring.
—
Day Three:
The final day was the hardest.
Every second dragged on like an eternity.
By the time the final class ended, students practically ran towards the auditorium, eager to hear the results. The entire school had gathered, filling the large hall with nervous energy.
The stage was set. The previous student council, now graduating, stood at the podium, ready to announce the results.
The entire room fell silent.
Kazama wiped imaginary sweat from his forehead. "Here we go…"
Ai clasped her hands together, a rare moment of genuine anticipation in her expression.
Nene and Masao held their breath.
Bo-chan blinked slowly.
And Shinchan?
He was slouching lazily, hands in his pockets, but his eyes had a spark of curiosity.
The results were about to be revealed.
You said:
shinchan as the moment actually, uncharacteristically started to feel nervous. but ai and his friend were aroound and with him and the results are annouced.
ChatGPT said:
As the student council president stepped up to the podium, the room fell into an expectant hush.
Shinchan, usually unfazed by anything school-related, found himself tapping his fingers against his thigh. It was uncharacteristic, even for him. He never got nervous about things like this. Tests? No problem. Getting caught for mischief? He could talk his way out. But this?
He suddenly cared.
Ai, standing beside him, must have noticed. She subtly nudged his arm with her elbow, her usual teasing smirk replaced with something softer. "Nervous, Shinchan?"
"Who, me?" He scoffed, stuffing his hands in his pockets. "Pfft, as if. I just don’t wanna deal with Kazama crying if we lose."
Kazama rolled his eyes but said nothing.
"Well, whatever happens," Nene whispered, "we did everything we could. And we had fun, right?"
Masao nodded. "Even if we lose, we still have each other!"
Ai chuckled. "That was incredibly cheesy, Masao-kun."
Bo-chan, as usual, stayed quiet. But his presence alone was oddly reassuring.
Shinchan let out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. Yeah. Whatever happens, happens.
The student council president cleared their throat. "Alright, everyone! The votes have been counted, double-checked, and we’re ready to announce your new student council!"
The tension in the auditorium thickened.
Shinchan felt Kazama stiffen next to him. Ai’s fingers subtly curled into a fist. Nene and Masao looked like they were about to explode from anticipation.
Shinchan swallowed. Why the hell am I this tense?
"And for your new Student Council President…"
A pause.
Shinchan felt his heart actually pound.
"With a majority vote…"
Shinchan really hated this suspense.
"Your new president is—"
A beat of silence.
Then—
"Nohara Shinnosuke!"
For a moment, there was only stunned silence.
Then, the room erupted in cheers, gasps, and murmurs.
Shinchan blinked. His brain short-circuited for a second.
"Wait." He pointed at himself. "Me?"
Kazama grabbed his shoulders and shook him. "YES, YOU, YOU ABSOLUTE IDIOT!"
Ai was beaming, her arms crossed proudly. "Did you expect anything else, President-kun?"
Masao and Nene cheered, their joy unmistakable.
Bo-chan gave a slow thumbs-up.
Shinchan looked around at his friends, at the crowd, at the stage—then ran a hand through his hair.
"Tch. Damn it…"
Kazama frowned. "What?!"
Shinchan grinned lazily. "Now I actually have to do work."
His friends groaned in unison, smacking his back as they laughed.
And just like that, the Nohara era of the student council began.
You said:
he walked to the stage with a non chalant face, but as he moved nearer there was a bright smile on his face.
ChatGPT said:
Shinchan stuffed his hands in his pockets and strolled toward the stage, his face as nonchalant as ever. The cheers and claps from the crowd barely seemed to register with him, as if this entire thing was nothing more than another school announcement he was too lazy to care about.
But as he stepped closer to the stage, something changed.
His usual lopsided smirk softened, then grew into a genuine, bright grin.
He didn't force it, nor did he try to hide it. It was just there, natural and real.
The moment wasn't lost on his friends.
Ai, watching him from below, felt her heart skip slightly. He’s happy… really happy.
Kazama adjusted his glasses, muttering under his breath, "Took him long enough to take something seriously."
Masao and Nene exchanged wide grins, and even Bo-chan, ever the quiet one, gave a slow, approving nod.
The outgoing student council president extended a hand as Shinchan stepped up. "Congratulations, Nohara. Looks like the students believe in you."
Shinchan took the handshake with ease, still grinning. "Hope they don’t regret it."
A few chuckles spread across the crowd, and just like that, Nohara Shinnosuke officially became the new Student Council President.
You said:
next chapter 34, ai invites the gang to celebrate in an expensive restruant. they celebrate long hard. make it long.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 34 - A Grand Celebration
The news of Shinchan’s victory spread across the school like wildfire. Some students were surprised, some expected it, and others… well, they were just along for the chaos that was bound to follow.
And so, Ai, ever the mastermind, decided there was only one proper way to celebrate—by throwing a luxurious dinner party at one of the finest restaurants in the city.
The Invitation
During lunch, Ai dramatically placed a single, elegant-looking envelope on the table in front of Shinchan. The rest of the group watched with confusion as she smiled, waiting for him to open it.
Shinchan, still half-distracted by his bento, lazily picked up the envelope and opened it. Inside was a fancy, glossy invitation card that read:
"A Grand Dinner in Celebration of Our New Student Council President!"
 Hosted by: Ai Suotome
"Oi… you already had this prepared, didn’t you?" Shinchan raised an eyebrow, his tone flat but amused.
Ai giggled. "What are you talking about? Of course not~"
Kazama, who had been drinking tea, almost choked. "You absolutely did!"
"She definitely did," Bo-chan nodded.
Nene leaned in. "Wait, where is this restaurant? The name sounds… fancy."
Ai waved a hand dismissively. "Oh, just a place my family frequents. You’ll love it!"
Masao looked down at his wallet, already sweating. "Ai-chan… we’re not paying, right?"
Ai gasped in mock offense. "Masao-kun, please! I wouldn’t make you pay at my celebration. It’s on me, of course!"
Shinchan chuckled. "Hooo~ I like the sound of that. Alright, I’ll come."
One by one, everyone agreed, though Masao still looked terrified at the mere idea of stepping into such a high-end place.
And so, the celebration was set.

The Restaurant
That evening, the group arrived in front of L'Opulence, an upscale, European-style restaurant with golden lights, velvet curtains, and a literal red carpet leading to the entrance.
Masao’s knees nearly gave out. "W-W-We’re eating here?! This place looks like they charge for the oxygen inside!"
Kazama adjusted his tie, looking both impressed and slightly out of place. "I knew Ai was rich, but this is on another level."
Bo-chan, as always, was calm. "Expensive bread."
Shinchan, however, was completely unfazed. He casually strolled inside, hands in his pockets, looking like he belonged. "Oi, don’t just stand there looking poor. Let’s go in."
Masao nearly fainted.
Ai smirked, taking his arm as they walked in. "Shinchan, you truly have the heart of a nobleman."
Inside, chandeliers sparkled, waiters moved with elegance, and the entire place smelled like money.
The group was escorted to a VIP section—Ai had reserved an entire private dining hall for them.
Masao sat down and immediately grabbed the menu. "O-Okay, I just need to find the cheapest thing here—"
His eyes widened.
The cheapest thing was water.
And it was 1,500 yen.
"I can’t breathe," he whispered.
Shinchan, on the other hand, was flipping through the menu like it was a cheap ramen shop. "Oi, what’s this ‘Chef’s Premium Wagyu Experience’?"
Ai clapped her hands together. "Oh! That’s a full-course meal with A5-grade Wagyu beef, hand-selected by the chef himself!"
Shinchan whistled. "Hoooo~ Sounds good. I’ll take two."
Masao visibly stopped breathing.
Nene leaned toward Ai, whispering, "Are you really okay with this? This is a lot…"
Ai smiled warmly. "Of course. It’s a celebration, after all! Besides…" Her gaze softened as she looked at Shinchan. "It’s not often I get to spoil him."
Kazama sighed, already accepting his fate. "Fine. If I’m going to eat expensive food, I might as well enjoy it."
Bo-chan nodded. "Once in a lifetime."
Masao, meanwhile, was staring at his menu, silently debating whether eating napkins would be a viable alternative.

The Feast
When the food arrived, it was like a scene out of a luxury drama. Plates of perfectly seared steak, butter-drizzled lobster, truffle-infused pasta, and golden-crusted desserts filled the table.
Shinchan took one bite of his steak and paused.
The group waited.
Then, suddenly—
"Umai!!" Shinchan’s eyes lit up as he dramatically held his head. "This… this isn’t just meat! This is a love letter from a cow!"
Kazama sighed. "Please don’t say it like that."
Masao took a tiny bite of his food. His pupils dilated. "This… this is richer than my entire bloodline…"
Nene giggled. "I have to admit, this is the best food I’ve ever had."
Ai beamed. "I’m glad you all like it!"
Bo-chan, in his usual calm voice, simply said, "I will never forget this day."
As the night went on, the group laughed, joked, and relived some of their favorite moments from the election.
Ai, of course, kept sneaking glances at Shinchan, watching as he casually enjoyed his food, cracked jokes, and unknowingly stole the spotlight in every conversation.
At one point, as she was lost in thought, she felt someone nudging her.
It was Nene.
She leaned in and whispered, "You’re staring too much~"
Ai nearly dropped her fork. "W-Wha— I-I was just—!"
Nene smirked. "Just looking at your beloved~?"
Ai turned beet red.
Shinchan, completely unaware, was cutting another piece of steak.
Kazama sighed. "I can already tell. With him as president… this school is doomed."
Bo-chan nodded. "Rest in peace."
Masao wiped a tear. "At least… at least we had good food before the chaos starts…"
Ai just smiled.
For tonight, none of that mattered.
Tonight, they celebrated.
You said:
they all walked home together home, its late in the evening. they leave together but shinchan walked a bit behind the rest, then ai join him behind. they talk, shinchan hold her hand as they walk then thanks her for changing him till a certain extent, then run forward to joke with the rest.
ChatGPT said:
A Quiet Moment
The celebration had been perfect. Their stomachs were full, their spirits were high, and for once, they had nothing to worry about—no elections, no schoolwork, no expectations. Just a quiet, peaceful night.
The group walked together under the dim glow of the streetlights. The streets were quieter at this hour, save for the occasional passing car or the distant sound of cicadas. Their laughter still lingered in the air from their dinner antics, but now, things had settled into a comfortable silence.
Shinchan, however, lagged behind.
Hands in his pockets, he strolled at his own pace, watching the backs of his friends as they chatted and teased one another.
Ai noticed.
She slowed her steps and, without a word, fell into step beside him.
For a moment, neither of them spoke. They just walked, side by side, in the soft glow of the streetlights.
Then, Ai glanced up at him. “You always do this, don’t you?”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Do what?”
“Walk behind. Like you’re watching everything from a distance.”
Shinchan smirked. “Well, someone’s gotta make sure no one gets kidnapped. Masao looks like an easy target.”
Ai giggled. “That’s not why.”
Shinchan didn’t respond immediately. He just kept walking, his gaze fixed ahead. Ai waited, knowing that if she was patient enough, he would answer in his own way.
After a moment, he sighed. “I guess… I just like watching, y’know? Everyone’s having fun, laughing… It’s nice to see.”
Ai softened. “You’re always watching over them.”
Shinchan scoffed. “Oi, don’t make it sound like I’m some kind of guardian angel or something.”
She giggled again. “More like a mischievous devil.”
“Hooo~ Now that I like.”
She nudged him playfully, and he chuckled. Then, without thinking much of it, he reached down and took her hand.
Ai’s breath hitched.
Her fingers fit perfectly in his—warm, steady, and completely natural, as if they had done this a thousand times before.
She looked up at him, expecting some teasing remark or a smug grin. But Shinchan just kept walking, his face calm, relaxed.
“Thanks,” he said quietly.
Ai blinked. “For what?”
He swung their hands a little. “For changing me.”
Ai felt her heart stop.
He didn’t say it dramatically. There was no teasing tone, no exaggerated gestures. It was just… simple. Honest.
She stared at him, wide-eyed, unsure of how to respond. But before she could, Shinchan suddenly grinned and let go of her hand.
Then, with his usual playful smirk, he jogged ahead to the rest of the group.
“Oi, Masao! Bet you can’t race me to the next light pole!”
Masao flailed. “EHH?! W-Wait, I just ate, I can’t run—!”
Nene rolled her eyes. “Honestly, do you ever take anything seriously?”
Bo-chan simply nodded. “Shinchan is Shinchan.”
Kazama sighed. “Just don’t trip and fall on your face.”
Ai stood there for a second, her hand still tingling where he had held it.
Then, slowly, a soft smile spread across her face.
Maybe he hadn’t changed completely. But… he had changed enough.
And for now, that was more than enough.
You said:
next chapter 35, responsiblities to be distributed among the grp, and they heading to see and settle in the student council office, and shinchan and the grp have to plan and manage the school festival.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 35 – A New Beginning
The morning after their celebratory dinner, reality came crashing back down on them.
Shinchan, now officially the student council president, found himself standing in front of the newly assigned student council office, staring at the door like it had personally offended him.
The rest of the group was there too—Ai, Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Bo-chan—each of them looking at the door with varying expressions. Ai looked eager. Kazama looked determined. Nene looked mildly interested. Bo-chan looked indifferent. Masao looked ready to collapse from stress.
Shinchan, however, looked completely and utterly uninterested.
“I feel like I’ve made a terrible mistake,” he muttered.
Kazama sighed. “You didn’t make the mistake. We did. By putting you in charge.”
“Hoo~ So you’re finally realizing it?”
Kazama ignored him. “Let’s just go inside.”
Ai, practically bouncing with excitement, stepped forward and pushed open the door.
Inside, the student council office was… underwhelming.
The walls were lined with cabinets filled with old documents, the large desk in the middle was covered in stacks of unorganized papers, and there was a single, slightly wobbly fan in the corner struggling to circulate the air.
“This… is it?” Masao whispered in disappointment.
Ai clapped her hands. “This is where we’ll make history!”
Nene frowned. “This is where I think we’ll die of exhaustion.”
Shinchan yawned. “Well, it’s been a good presidency, but I think I’ll retire.”
Kazama grabbed him by the collar before he could leave. “You’re not running away from this.”
Bo-chan nodded. “We should clean up first.”
And so, the first task of their new reign as the student council was… tidying up.
Distributing Responsibilities
Once they had successfully conquered the chaos that was their new office, Ai wasted no time in organizing their roles.
“As the President, Shinchan will oversee everything and be the face of the council!” she announced proudly.
Shinchan leaned back in his chair, feet on the table. “Sounds easy. I accept.”
Kazama smacked his feet off the table.
“Kazama will be the Vice President, handling all the actual work,” Ai continued.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Obviously.”
“Nene-chan, you’ll be in charge of finances and budgeting.”
Nene sighed. “Ugh, fine. But if we’re going to be poor, let’s at least spend it on something fun.”
“Bo-chan, you’ll be in charge of logistics and communication.”
Bo-chan gave a slow nod. “Understood.”
“Masao-kun, you’re in charge of public relations!”
Masao blinked. “Public what now?”
“You’ll handle all announcements and make sure people actually care about student council events!”
Masao immediately started sweating. “T-Talking in front of people?!”
Ai ignored his panic and continued. “And I will be the Secretary, making sure everything runs smoothly!”
Shinchan smirked. “So basically, you’re making sure I don’t slack off?”
Ai smiled sweetly. “Oh no, I’ll be making sure all of you don’t slack off.”
A collective groan filled the room.
Planning the School Festival
With their roles set, the next big responsibility was looming over them—the school festival.
They all gathered around the table, staring at a blank sheet of paper where their plans were supposed to be.
“Alright, what’s the theme of the festival?” Kazama asked.
Masao raised a trembling hand. “What about… a haunted house?”
Nene rolled her eyes. “That’s so basic.”
Bo-chan thought for a moment. “A cultural festival theme could work.”
Shinchan perked up. “How about a food festival? We eat all day and call it student engagement.”
Kazama sighed. “That’s just an excuse to stuff your face.”
Ai clapped her hands. “We can combine different elements! A main stage for performances, a food section, class-run events, and a competition to boost participation!”
Masao gulped. “Competition?”
Ai smirked. “Of course! Something fun, exciting, and engaging!”
Shinchan rubbed his chin. “How about a battle royale?”
Kazama sighed. “No.”
“A giant obstacle course where we fight for survival?”
“No.”
“A contest to see who can eat the most yakisoba?”
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. “That’s just you wanting free food!”
Ai giggled. “Let’s put together a solid proposal first. We need to discuss this with the teachers before anything.”
And so, with their responsibilities set and the school festival now their top priority, the student council officially began their work.
Shinchan stretched lazily and smirked at the chaos unfolding before him.
This was going to be fun.
You said:
now that they were in the coucil, they had to make sure which class was doin which stall. which grp was doing indivdual events, the sponsors, the promotion, the displin. they also had to figure out with their own class event/stall.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 36 – The Chaos of Planning
Now that the festival plans were officially rolling, the real work began.
The student council was responsible for ensuring every class had a stall or event, assigning event spaces, managing sponsors, handling promotions, and making sure everything didn’t spiral into absolute chaos.
…Which, given that Shinchan was their president, was a real possibility.
Sorting Out the Stalls
Inside the student council room, the group sat around a large table, looking at a giant list of all the classes and their chosen events.
Kazama tapped his pen against his clipboard. “Alright, we have to confirm which class is doing what, approve their ideas, and assign them locations.”
Ai nodded, flipping through her own notes. “Most classes already submitted their plans, so we just need to finalize everything.”
Shinchan leaned back in his chair. “Lemme guess… the first-years mostly went with the usual haunted houses, cafés, and game stalls?”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Correct. But the second and third-years have a mix of creative and ridiculous ideas.”
Masao, nervously flipping through the papers, gulped. “Class 3-B wants to do an ‘Ultimate Ninja Challenge’ where people have to go through an extreme obstacle course… and if they lose, they get dunked in ice water.”
Bo-chan nodded. “Class 2-D is planning a survival horror escape room with real scare actors.”
Nene raised an eyebrow. “Class 3-C wants to do a host club where the third-years act like anime-style butlers and princes?”
Shinchan whistled. “That one’s gonna be a hit.”
Ai clapped her hands. “We’ll approve most of these, but we need to be mindful of logistics. We have limited space and need to spread things out evenly.”
Kazama sighed. “And we have to stop some of these classes from killing their customers…”
Shinchan smirked. “So… we’re rejecting the dunk-tank ninja course?”
Kazama stared at him. “Obviously.”
Assigning Roles
After finalizing the stalls, the group moved on to discussing individual events like performances, competitions, and stage shows.
Ai flipped through the sign-up sheet. “We have a talent show, a trivia contest, a cooking battle, a cosplay competition, and… oh, a ‘King of the Festival’ popularity contest.”
Nene raised an eyebrow. “A popularity contest? That sounds like something Ai-chan would want Shinchan to enter.”
Ai smiled sweetly. “Oh, I already signed him up.”
Shinchan choked on his drink. “Excuse me?!”
Kazama sighed. “Why am I not surprised?”
Bo-chan tilted his head. “The contest is judged by audience votes, right?”
Ai nodded. “Yes! It’s meant to be fun, and the winner gets a special reward from the festival committee.”
Shinchan groaned. “I swear, you just want to use me as a marketing strategy.”
Ai beamed. “You’re catching on!”
Sponsorships and Promotion
The next big hurdle was securing sponsors and promoting the event.
Kazama sighed. “We need to secure funding. The school gives us a budget, but if we want any extras, we need sponsors.”
Masao gulped. “W-We have to go ask real businesses?”
Ai nodded. “Yes! We’ll approach local shops, restaurants, and even some big companies to see if they’re willing to donate or sponsor an event.”
Shinchan smirked. “We could ask my dad’s company.”
Kazama blinked. “That… might actually work.”
Shinchan shrugged. “No promises though. My dad’s boss is kinda stingy.”
Nene leaned forward. “We could also ask Ai-chan’s family company. I mean, they’re loaded, right?”
Ai tapped her chin. “I could convince my father, but I’d need a good reason.”
Shinchan smirked. “Tell him I’ll personally endorse his brand if he sponsors us.”
Kazama sighed. “That sounds both incredibly stupid and incredibly effective.”
Ai giggled. “Alright, leave it to me!”
Their Own Class Stall
Finally, the group had to decide what their own class would be doing.
Shinchan stretched. “Alright, what are we doing for our class? Something fun. Something easy. Something that doesn’t require effort.”
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. “That’s the opposite of what we need.”
Nene smirked. “What about a maid café?”
Masao choked. “W-Wait, that means we’d have to—”
Nene clapped her hands. “Exactly.”
Shinchan raised a hand. “I vote no.”
Kazama raised his hand. “Also no.”
Masao and Bo-chan nodded in agreement.
Ai pouted. “You guys have no vision.”
Shinchan smirked. “We could always do a ‘Shinchan’s Food Paradise’ stall.”
Kazama deadpanned. “That just sounds like you eating the profits.”
Bo-chan, in his usual calm voice, spoke. “What about a festival-style food stall?”
Ai’s eyes lit up. “That could work! We could sell taiyaki, yakisoba, and other festival treats!”
Kazama nodded. “It’s manageable, profitable, and doesn’t require too much setup.”
Shinchan grinned. “And I get to eat.”
Kazama sighed. “Within reason.”
The Countdown Begins
With all the responsibilities laid out—stalls, events, sponsors, promotions, and their own class stall—the festival preparation was officially in motion.
Shinchan stretched, looking around the room.
“Well… this is gonna be a lot of work.”
Ai smiled. “It’s going to be fun!”
Masao whimpered. “It’s going to be stressful.”
Nene smirked. “It’s going to be chaotic.”
Bo-chan simply nodded. “It’ll be interesting.”
Kazama sighed. “And we’re stuck managing all of it…”
Shinchan smirked. “Guess we better get to work, huh?”
And so, the countdown to the school festival began.
You said:
they headed to the class and after a "long" disscussion the girls of the class decided a reverse maid cafe, where the boys will be the maids, and the girls the butller.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 37 – The Reverse Maid Café Incident
After wrapping up their student council duties for the day, the group finally returned to their classroom to finalize their class’s festival event.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Alright, we need something that’s fun, engaging, and profitable. Preferably something that doesn’t require too much effort.”
Shinchan stretched. “Food stalls are easy, right? Let’s just make takoyaki or something.”
Masao looked hopeful. “Yeah, something simple…”
Nene smirked. “Oh? But wouldn’t it be so much more fun to do something different?”
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. “I don’t like that tone.”
Ai clapped her hands. “Everyone! Let’s brainstorm properly. If anyone has a good idea, now’s the time to say it.”
And then, chaos erupted.
The “Discussion”
The classroom buzzed with energy as everyone started shouting ideas.
“How about a haunted house?”
 “Too much work!”
“A fortune-telling booth?”
 “Nobody’s psychic!”
“A café?”
 “…That’s so normal.”
Nene suddenly clapped her hands. “I got it! How about… a reverse maid café?”
Silence.
Then, murmurs started spreading across the room.
Shinchan blinked. “Reverse… maid café?”
Ai’s eyes sparkled. “Ohhh, I like the sound of that.”
Masao gulped. “W-What does that mean?”
Nene grinned. “Simple. Instead of the usual maid café where cute girls dress up as maids, the boys will be the maids… and we, the girls, will be the butlers.”
Kazama choked. “E-Excuse me?!”
Bo-chan blinked slowly. “…That’s unusual.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Wait, wait. So you’re saying I have to dress in a maid outfit?”
Nene beamed. “Yep!”
Masao started sweating. “N-No way! That’s humiliating!”
One of the other girls giggled. “Oh come on, it’ll be cute~”
Kazama crossed his arms. “There’s no way we’re agreeing to this.”
Ai smirked. “Oh? Afraid you won’t look good in a frilly dress, Kazama-kun?”
Kazama twitched. “That’s not the point!”
Shinchan rubbed his chin. “Actually… this could be hilarious.”
Masao panicked. “No, don’t encourage this!”
The girls started chatting excitedly, discussing uniforms and potential café themes. The boys, meanwhile, exchanged horrified glances.
Kazama sighed. “This is going to be a disaster.”
Shinchan smirked. “Nah, this is gonna be amazing.”
And so, after a long debate (which was mostly the boys suffering), the class officially voted.
The Reverse Maid Café was happening.
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 38 – Preparations and Love in the Air
The school festival was fast approaching, and the student council, along with the entire student body, was buzzing with energy.
With all the responsibilities thrown at them, Shinchan and his group barely had time to breathe. From handling purchases, sponsors, promotion, and supervising events across all classes—there was always something to do.
Yet, despite the workload, the atmosphere was strangely fun. The entire school was caught in a whirlwind of preparations, and with it…
Romance was blooming everywhere.

Managing the Chaos
“Shinchan! The second-years are fighting over booth spaces again!”
Shinchan sighed as he scratched his head. “Do they think I’m some magical referee?”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Technically, you are the student council president.”
“Details, details.”
Ai smiled, standing beside him with a clipboard. “Come on, let’s settle it quickly. The faster we do this, the faster we can go back to planning our class’s event.”
The group walked toward the commotion, where two second-year representatives were yelling at each other.
“This space belongs to Class 2-B!”
 “No way! Class 2-A reserved it first!”
Shinchan sighed. “Alright, let’s settle this the Shinchan way.”
Kazama raised an eyebrow. “Which is?”
Shinchan pulled out a single candy.
“…Rock-paper-scissors. Best out of three.”
Everyone blinked.
The second-years hesitated, then shrugged. “Fine.”
Three rounds later, Class 2-A won. The argument was settled in less than a minute.
Kazama sighed. “I hate that this actually worked.”
Ai giggled. “Shinchan has his ways.”

Sponsorship Struggles
Meanwhile, Masao and Bo-chan were handling sponsorship deals.
Masao held a clipboard, sweating bullets. “U-Um, we’d like to ask if you’d be interested in sponsoring our school festival…?”
The store manager raised an eyebrow. “And why should I?”
Masao gulped. “Uh… b-because… we’re working really hard?”
Bo-chan blinked. “We can promote your store in our festival magazine.”
The manager rubbed his chin. “Hmm. That’s a good deal. Alright, I’ll sponsor the drinks stand.”
Masao nearly collapsed from relief. “T-Thank you!”

Marketing Madness
Nene and Ai were in charge of promotions.
“We need posters everywhere,” Nene declared.
Ai smirked. “How about a little drama to hype things up?”
And so, during the school’s morning assembly, Ai dramatically stood up in the middle of the crowd and loudly declared,
“To all students! Prepare for the greatest event of the year—the upcoming school festival! Brace yourselves for fun, excitement, and romance~!”
Everyone turned toward her, completely caught off guard.
Even the teachers were stunned.
Shinchan, watching from the side, snorted. “Damn. That’s bold.”
Kazama facepalmed. “She has no shame.”
But… the students loved it.
By lunchtime, the school was buzzing with anticipation. Ai’s little stunt worked, and soon, everyone was talking about the upcoming event.

Love is in the Air
With all the festival hype, something unexpected happened.
The entire school became a breeding ground for romance.
Confessions were happening left and right.
People were pairing up, couples were forming, and the atmosphere was filled with tension.
Nene smirked. “It’s happening. Festival romance season is here.”
Masao gulped. “I… I can feel the pressure.”
Bo-chan blinked. “You think you’ll get a confession?”
Masao blushed. “W-Who knows?! Maybe! Hopefully?!”
Kazama scoffed. “You’re all getting distracted.”
Ai, leaning in closer to Shinchan, whispered, “What about you, Shinchan? Feeling the festival romance?”
Shinchan smirked. “Romance? Never heard of it.”
Ai pouted. “You’re no fun.”
But… for just a moment, Ai could’ve sworn she saw Shinchan glance at her a little longer than usual.
Maybe, just maybe, even he wasn’t immune to the festival magic.

Chapter 39 – The Calm Before the Festival
After an exhausting day of preparations, Shinchan dragged himself back home, barely able to keep his eyes open.
The school festival was only a few days away, and the workload had been insane. Meetings, planning, rehearsals—he had done it all.
As he stepped through the door, he was greeted by an excited Himawari.
“Nii-chan! Welcome back!” She ran up to him, bouncing on her feet. “How was your day?”
“Long,” Shinchan sighed, tossing his bag onto the couch. “But at least it’s almost over.”
Misae peeked out from the kitchen. “You’ve been coming home tired every day. You sure you’re not overdoing it?”
Hiroshi, reading the newspaper, smirked. “The ‘Great Shinchan’ is working hard, huh?”
Shinchan waved a hand. “Yeah, yeah. I’m just making sure things don’t go too crazy.”
Himawari’s eyes sparkled. “Does that mean the festival is soon?!”
Shinchan grinned and pulled out a small invitation.
“Here. You guys should come.”
Misae took the invite and smiled. “Oh? You’re actually inviting us?”
Hiroshi raised an eyebrow. “You must be proud of this if you’re making an official invite.”
“Not really,” Shinchan shrugged. “Just figured it’d be a waste if you didn’t see me in a maid outfit.”
Misae nearly dropped the invitation.
Himawari burst out laughing. “Nii-chan’s gonna be a maid?! I HAVE to see this!”
Hiroshi wiped a fake tear. “My son has finally learned the true purpose of school festivals.”
Misae sighed. “I can’t believe we raised him.”

Elsewhere – The Others’ Homes
At Kazama’s House
Kazama sat at his desk, meticulously organizing his festival notes.
His mother peeked into his room. “You’ve been busy lately.”
Kazama adjusted his glasses. “Being vice president requires precision and dedication.”
His mom smiled. “I’m looking forward to it. Should I bring anything?”
“…Just a camera. You’ll want to capture Shinchan’s suffering.”

At Ai’s House
Ai sat in her luxurious living room, sipping tea.
“A school festival, huh?” Her butler, Sebastian, smiled. “I assume it will be quite the spectacle?”
Ai smirked. “Oh, definitely. It’s going to be legendary.”
She held her own invitation, spinning it between her fingers.
“And I personally invited a few special guests…”

At Nene’s House
“A reverse maid café?!” Nene’s mom gasped in delight.
Nene rolled her eyes. “It was the class’s decision, Mom.”
Her mom wiped a tear. “My daughter, finally living my high school dreams.”

At Masao’s House
Masao sat at the dinner table, nervously poking at his food.
“I-I might actually get confessed to,” he whispered to himself.
His mom blinked. “By who?”
Masao’s face turned red. “D-Don’t ask!!”

At Bo-chan’s House
Bo-chan sat silently, painting on a canvas.
His mom walked by. “Looking forward to the festival?”
He simply nodded, a small smile forming.

The Festival Arrives
And so…
The weekend arrived.
The school gates opened early in the morning, and students ran around in high-energy excitement.
Banners were everywhere. Booths were being set up, music played in the background, and the delicious smell of festival food filled the air.
Shinchan and the group stood at the entrance, looking at the massive event they had helped organize.
Nene stretched. “After all the work we did, this better be good.”
Kazama crossed his arms. “It will be good. We made sure of it.”
Masao gulped. “I feel like something’s gonna go wrong.”
Bo-chan nodded.
Ai, standing beside Shinchan, smirked. “Ready for chaos, President?”
Shinchan put his hands behind his head.
“Always.”
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 40 – The Festival Begins
Shinchan stood at the front gates of the school, arms crossed, watching as waves of students, parents, and guests poured into the festival grounds.
The early morning rush was chaotic, but it was exactly what they had planned for.
“Alright,” Kazama adjusted his tie. “Let’s welcome our VIPs.”
The gang straightened up as a line of parents, alumni, and even students from nearby schools approached.
Misae, Hiroshi, and Himawari were among them, looking around excitedly. Ai’s butler, Sebastian, stood at her side, calmly observing the festival. Other students were busy waving to their families, guiding them toward the various attractions.
Shinchan yawned. “Okay, okay, let’s get this over with.”
They took their positions, standing officially as representatives of the student council.
“Welcome to the Kasukabe High School Festival!” Ai announced, her voice bright and charming.
Kazama followed up smoothly. “We’ve worked hard to prepare various activities and performances for you all to enjoy. We hope you have a wonderful time.”
Each guest was greeted politely, and their student council team took turns escorting parents and important visitors to different areas.
It wasn’t long before they were able to delegate the task to other members, letting the hospitality team handle the arrivals.
Shinchan stretched. “Okay, we’re free. Let’s make sure the festival isn’t on fire yet.”
They moved through the school, visiting the various classes and booths, checking if everything was running smoothly.
The haunted house was already gaining a long line of eager students. The takoyaki stall from Class 2-B smelled amazing, and the courtyard was bustling with students running food stands, game booths, and even a small live music performance.
At every stop, the committee members reported to them.
“The gymnasium is prepped for the afternoon stage performances.”
“The sports events are running as scheduled, no delays.”
“The cultural exhibitions are drawing in a lot of attention.”
Shinchan nodded along as Kazama took note of everything.
Even their own class’s reverse maid café was already getting customers.
“I bet half the people coming in just want to see Kazama dressed up,” Shinchan said casually.
Kazama twitched. “I refuse to acknowledge that.”
“You’re the vice president. You must acknowledge it.”
Kazama sighed heavily. “I hate this.”
As they moved on, Ai linked arms with Shinchan, tilting her head. “Aren’t you excited for your turn?”
Shinchan gave her a deadpan stare. “Yeah, I’m thrilled.”

By the time noon rolled around, the school festival was running at full speed.
“Alright,” Kazama closed his notebook. “Time to handle our class shift.”
Shinchan sighed. “Time to dress as a maid, huh?”
Nene clapped her hands. “Let’s go, let’s go! We need to get you boys looking perfect.”
Masao looked like he was going to cry.
Bo-chan… just accepted his fate.
Ai smirked. “Oh, I’ve been waiting for this.”
As they were dragged off to change, Shinchan glanced at the festival one last time.
Everything was moving smoothly.
And now, it was time for their own event.
You said:

Chapter 41 – Maid Wars and Unexpected Guests
The changing room was buzzing with chaos as Shinchan and the rest of the boys got dressed.
The girls had mercilessly taken charge of the outfits, ensuring every detail was flawless.
Kazama adjusted the frilly lace cuffs on his wrists, his face set in stone-cold resignation. “I cannot believe this.”
Shinchan, standing in front of the mirror, pulled at the tight corset-style bodice with mild irritation. “I feel like a badly wrapped present.”
Bo-chan, ever the silent force, stood in absolute peace, wearing his maid uniform with quiet dignity.
Masao, on the other hand, was on the verge of tears. “I look like a tragic princess…”
Ai and Nene clapped their hands in glee.
“Now, now, don’t fight it,” Ai said, adjusting Shinchan’s black and white frilly maid headband. “Just accept it.”
“You know,” Shinchan sighed, crossing his arms, “you seem to be enjoying this a little too much.”
Ai tilted her head innocently. “Who, me? No way~.”
Once everything was in place, they stood before the mirror.
And despite the ridiculous outfits…
They all looked shockingly good.
Shinchan’s sharp features contrasted against the soft, elegant maid uniform, making him look strikingly attractive. The black skirt and white apron emphasized his well-built frame rather than making him look silly.
Kazama, with his refined and almost princely aura, carried himself with so much dignity that it was unfair. He didn’t look like a joke at all—he looked dangerously charming.
Bo-chan was… Bo-chan. Silent. Mysterious. He somehow made the maid outfit look poetic.
Masao, despite his crying, had the aura of an anime heroine stuck in a tragic comedy.
Before they could complain further, the door burst open.
“OI, NIISAN!”
Himawari’s voice rang out like a war horn.
They barely had time to react before she stormed in with her middle school friends.
Shinchan froze.
So did Kazama.
So did Bo-chan.
So did Masao, who started choking on air.
Himawari beamed. “I had to come see my brother, the student council president, in a maid outfit! It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience!”
Her middle school friends stared in silent awe.
“Whoa…” one of the girls whispered. “I expected this to be a joke, but why do they actually look good?”
Another one nudged Himawari. “Your brother is actually kind of cool, huh?”
Himawari gagged. “Don’t say disgusting things.”
Shinchan, still standing like a deer in headlights, slowly turned to Kazama.
“Kazama. Execute Plan B.”
Kazama nodded solemnly. “Understood.”
They both grabbed Masao and used him as a human shield before running out of the changing room.
“Oi!” Himawari shouted. “Get back here!”
But before she could chase them—
Another familiar voice rang out.
“Well, well, if it isn’t my greatest rivals.”
Hayashi, their election rival, stood at the doorway, arms crossed.
He had a smug grin… but his eye twitched uncontrollably as he took in their maid outfits.
“…I have no words,” he said flatly.
Kazama, who had been about to escape, stopped.
And then, in the most calm and serious tone, said:
“…What brings you here, Hayashi?”
Hayashi pinched the bridge of his nose. “I came to see if you were taking your student council duties seriously. But clearly…” He waved his hand at their outfits. “You’re all… occupied.”
Ai, standing at the side, giggled. “Aww, are you jealous? You should’ve joined us.”
Hayashi’s soul left his body. “Over my dead body.”
Just as things couldn’t get worse—
“Shin-chan?”
A new voice entered the battlefield.
They all turned their heads.
Standing in the doorway was a tall girl, wearing a casual yet athletic-looking outfit.
Rika Miyamoto.
The vice-captain of the kendo club.
Her sharp, piercing eyes locked onto Shinchan.
The boy she once knew as a kendo prodigy.
The same boy who had left the dojo years ago without looking back.
And now…
She was looking at him, in a maid outfit.
“…What,” Rika said slowly, blinking in disbelief, “the hell am I looking at?”
Shinchan just stared.
Ai elbowed him. “Ooh, Shin-chan~ Who’s this? Another girl from your past?”
Shinchan rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I’m too tired for this.”
Rika crossed her arms. “I came to see if it was really you. And it is.” She scanned him from head to toe. “What happened to the kendo warrior I once knew?”
Kazama coughed. “I believe he’s currently experiencing a character development arc.”
Shinchan sighed deeply. “Listen, I can explain.”
Before he could, though—
“Shinnosuke?”
And then… the final boss appeared.
Misae.
Hiroshi.
Sebastian.
And a small crowd of other parents.
All standing there.
All looking directly at them.
Shinchan slowly turned his head to face them.
His mother, staring at him with a blank, unreadable expression.
His father, looking like he was physically holding back laughter.
Sebastian, nodding approvingly. “A very fine choice of uniform, young master.”
Shinchan just sighed.
Masao fainted on the spot.
Bo-chan sipped his juice.
The entire festival was just getting started.
You said:
dont make them come at the same time. they come, order, interactions happen, some one else comes.... and things progress. and shinchan isnt embarassed as much as the rest, he embrassing his beauty hilariously.

Chapter 41 – A Maid Café Like No Other
The bell at the entrance chimed as the first set of customers entered.
Shinchan flicked a strand of his hair back gracefully, looking at his reflection in a hand mirror. “I must say, this frilly uniform does a splendid job of enhancing my already radiant beauty.”
Kazama gritted his teeth as he adjusted his lacy sleeves. “Why are you so unbothered by this?”
“I’m not just unbothered, Kazama,” Shinchan said dramatically, twirling slightly so his skirt flared. “I am thriving.”
Masao, on the other hand, was hiding behind a menu, his face completely red. “C-Can I just stay in the back and wash dishes?”
Before anyone could answer, the first guest walked in.
Himawari.
And she wasn’t alone.
She had brought three of her middle school friends.
The moment her eyes landed on Shinchan, she stopped in place.
Her middle school friends blinked in confusion.
“…Wait,” one of them whispered. “You told us your brother was the student council president. You didn’t say he was also…” She gestured at the maid outfit.
Another girl whispered excitedly. “Why does he actually look kinda… you know?”
Himawari snapped her head toward them. “No, I don’t know. Stop.”
Meanwhile, Shinchan casually walked up to them with a charming smile. “Welcome, dear customers. How may I, the most elegant of maids, serve you today?”
Himawari grabbed a chair and sat down aggressively.
“Niisan,” she said, deadpan. “What. The. Hell.”
Shinchan placed a delicate hand over his heart. “I know. It is simply unfair how even in this attire, my divine looks continue to flourish.”
Himawari gagged.
Her friends were blushing for some reason.
Kazama approached with a fake business smile. “Would you all like to place an order?”
Himawari narrowed her eyes. “I want one plate of ‘get me out of here.’”
“Apologies,” Shinchan said smoothly, “but our chef says that dish is currently unavailable.”
Just as Himawari was about to throw something at her brother—
The bell rang again.
A new customer entered.
And the room went silent.
Hayashi.
The rival from the election.
He had walked in with his usual confidence—but the moment he took in the sight before him, he froze in place.
His gaze locked onto Shinchan in a maid outfit.
Shinchan slowly turned to face him.
Their eyes met.
Silence.
“…So,” Hayashi said at last, pinching the bridge of his nose. “This is what the student council has become.”
Shinchan smiled. “You’re just jealous you’re not as stunning as me in a maid dress.”
“I—WHAT?”
Kazama coughed. “Would you like a table?”
Hayashi, still processing the insanity before him, slowly sat down—across from Himawari.
The two exchanged looks.
“…You’re here too?” Hayashi asked.
“I’m suffering just as much as you are,” Himawari said flatly.
Hayashi groaned, rubbing his temples.
Meanwhile, Shinchan gracefully poured tea into a cup. “Now, Hayashi. What brings you here? Don’t tell me… you were curious about how I look in a maid outfit?”
Hayashi almost choked. “AS IF!”
Just as things were heating up—
The bell rang again.
The moment Shinchan turned his head, he saw someone he did not expect to see today.
Rika Miyamoto.
The vice-captain of the kendo club.
She stepped into the room, her sharp gaze sweeping the café—before landing directly on Shinchan.
And she froze.
“…Shinchan?”
Kazama winced. “Here we go.”
Rika’s eyebrow twitched as she took in Shinchan, the so-called kendo prodigy, dressed as a frilly maid.
She slowly crossed her arms.
“…Is this a fever dream?”
Shinchan exhaled dramatically. “I know, I know. My elegance in this outfit is simply overwhelming.”
Rika stared at him.
Then at Kazama.
Then at Masao, who was shaking behind the counter.
“…I’m going to need a drink,” Rika muttered, grabbing the nearest menu.
“Coming right up,” Shinchan said, spinning like a ballroom dancer before walking to the kitchen.
“…Is he okay?” Rika asked.
Kazama sipped his own tea. “He’s thriving, actually.”
As if the situation wasn’t bad enough—
The bell rang again.
And this time…
It was Misae.
Hiroshi.
And Sebastian.
The final boss battle had begun.
Shinchan, with the elegance of a noblewoman, turned dramatically.
“Mother. Father. Butler.”
Misae blinked.
Hiroshi bit his lip to keep from laughing.
Sebastian, unfazed, nodded approvingly. “A truly sophisticated uniform, young master.”
Kazama sighed. “Why does he sound prouder than usual?”
Shinchan approached his mother. “Would you like to place an order, dear mother?”
Misae crossed her arms. “…We’ll take a table.”
As they sat down, Masao whispered to Kazama.
“…How is he so calm?”
Kazama sighed. “Because he stopped feeling shame years ago.”
And so…
The **greatest chaos in the history of their school festival began.
You said:
their shift continued, for the day, after which they went to continue with other works. during which shinchan comes across the previous student council president in the middle of shit ton of work. the previous one was like kazama, but multiple time better but at the same time was similar to shinchan, extremly chill, and mature. and they talked, and shinchan got some unexpected advices and a new friend too.

Chapter 42 – A President’s Burden and a New Friend
The festival buzzed with life as the maid café’s shift finally ended.
Kazama immediately collapsed into a chair, sighing in exhaustion. “I can’t believe we survived that.”
Masao, still trembling from the sheer humiliation, whispered, “I think I saw my soul leave my body back there…”
Shinchan, meanwhile, stretched his arms leisurely, as if he had just returned from a relaxing spa trip. “Ah… That was exhilarating.”
Kazama narrowed his eyes. “You enjoyed that way too much.”
Shinchan smirked. “I was merely embracing my natural charm, Kazama. It would be a crime to deny the world such beauty.”
“Shut up.”
After a quick change of clothes, the group dispersed to check on other festival duties.
They still had a ton of work left.
Shinchan, whistling to himself, decided to take a solo patrol around the campus to see how things were running.
That’s when he stumbled upon—
A disaster zone.
One of the festival’s main event areas looked like it had been through a small war. Papers were scattered, boxes were piled up, and multiple students were running around like headless chickens.
In the middle of it all—
A lone figure sat calmly at a desk, flipping through documents.
Shinchan immediately recognized him.
Souta Minami.
The previous student council president.
The one Shinchan had replaced.
He had heard stories about Minami-senpai.
The guy was basically Kazama on steroids—highly competent, efficient, and could probably juggle three different jobs while solving a Rubik’s cube.
But, at the same time…
He was also known for being incredibly chill and laid-back.
A weird mix of Kazama and himself, in a way.
Minami-senpai finally noticed him and smirked.
“Yo. The new king himself.”
Shinchan walked over, glancing at the absolute mess around them. “Did a typhoon hit this place?”
Minami sighed. “Might as well have. You’d think after stepping down, I’d be free, but nope. Here I am, doing damage control.”
Shinchan clicked his tongue. “Man, being a former president sucks, huh?”
Minami chuckled. “It has its moments.” He set a paper down and leaned back in his chair. “So? How’s your reign going so far, Your Highness?”
Shinchan smirked. “Honestly? Feels like I got thrown into a burning building.”
Minami laughed. “Yeah, sounds about right.”
Shinchan plopped into a chair beside him. “How the hell did you do this for a whole year?”
Minami thought for a moment before answering.
“…You just kinda figure it out.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow.
Minami continued, “At first, you try to do everything perfectly. You take on too much, micromanage every detail—just like Kazama over there.”
Shinchan nodded. “Yeah, that nerd needs to chill.”
Minami smirked. “But then you realize something important.”
He tapped his fingers on the table.
“You can’t do it all alone.”
Shinchan stopped twirling a pen in his hand.
Minami leaned forward slightly.
“The reason I didn’t crumble under all this work?” He gestured at the chaos around them. “I had a good team. I trusted them. I let them do their thing. I didn’t try to carry everything on my own shoulders.”
Shinchan listened carefully.
“Doesn’t matter how competent you are,” Minami continued. “You need people. And from what I’ve heard, you’ve got a solid group.”
Shinchan thought about Ai, Kazama, Nene, Masao, Bo-chan.
Minami smirked. “Let them help you, man.”
Shinchan clicked his tongue. “Tch. You talk like some wise old man.”
Minami grinned. “Well, you’re the one asking for advice.”
Shinchan leaned back, crossing his arms. “Alright, alright. I’ll consider it.”
Minami stretched. “Good. Now, you gonna help me clean this mess or just sit there looking pretty?”
Shinchan smirked. “Oh, Minami-senpai. I’m always pretty.”
“Shut up and grab those boxes.”
Shinchan laughed and got to work.
Just like that—
A new friendship was formed.
You said:
the festival ended for the day, with their work, it continued tommor too, but due to shift in the working force they would be free after moring. so they talked about their plan of action to explore the festival as they started to leave for the day. but ai and shin didnt know the grp preplnned to allow them ti be alone. and they didnt knew how an unexpected ship was going to sail tommorw between nene and masao, and kazama and himawari. but the ship sails in the chapter after this one.

Chapter 43 – The Night Before the Storm
The sun dipped below the horizon as the first day of the festival came to a close.
Students scrambled to clean up, teachers did final checks, and stall owners counted their earnings for the day.
Shinchan and the gang, having finished their student council duties, gathered near the school gate, stretching their exhausted bodies.
“Alright,” Kazama adjusted his glasses, his posture still stiff despite the long day. “Tomorrow, our shifts are only in the morning. After that, we’re free to enjoy the festival as visitors.”
“That means,” Ai clapped her hands together, “we should plan our route! What do we want to check out first?”
Nene, grinning mischievously, glanced at the others. “Hmm, how about we split up into pairs? It’ll be easier to explore that way.”
Bo-chan, ever so wise, simply nodded. “That would be… effective.”
Masao, oblivious to the scheming, tilted his head. “I guess that makes sense. Less waiting around.”
Shinchan yawned. “As long as I get food first, I don’t care what we do.”
Ai blinked innocently. “Then, Shinchan and I will go together, right?”
“Hmm? Sure, whatever.” Shinchan shrugged.
Kazama cleared his throat. “Then, I suppose—”
“Oh, Kazama, you’ll go with Hima!” Nene cut him off smoothly.
Kazama’s brain lagged. “Huh?”
Himawari, who had arrived just in time to overhear, smirked like a predator. “Oh my~ You’ll be taking responsibility for me, Senpai?”
Kazama’s soul ascended.
Masao chuckled awkwardly. “Then… I guess Nene and I are together?”
Nene shrugged, hiding a smirk. “Guess so.”
Ai, ever so graceful, put her hands on her hips. “Perfect! Everything is settled.”
Shinchan, completely unaware of the plot unfolding, stretched again. “Alright then, I’m heading home.”
“Me too,” Kazama said quickly, his face still slightly red.
One by one, they all started to leave.
Ai smiled to herself. Tomorrow would be interesting.
Little did she know—
The ships would set sail whether they were ready or not.
You said:

Chapter 44 – A Festival to Remember (Part 1)
The second day of the festival arrived with clear skies and a crisp morning breeze.
By the time the gang had finished their morning shifts, managing the last bits of organization, confirming event schedules, and making sure no troublemakers were ruining the festival, the workload finally eased.
As planned, they were free for the rest of the day.
But as they excitedly split into their groups, they completely forgot one thing.
Bo-chan.
As the three pairs left, Bo-chan stood alone, blinking in slow realization.
“…Oh.”
A small pause.
Then, he simply turned and walked away peacefully.
It was a blessing in disguise.
Bo-chan enjoyed a quiet, stress-free exploration of the festival, taking his time appreciating the artwork display, enjoying some local snacks, and even sitting by the koi pond for a full hour in complete serenity.
Meanwhile—
The other six were not nearly as peaceful.
Pair 1 – Kazama & Himawari
Kazama adjusted his glasses, trying to maintain his composure as Himawari led him through the crowded festival stalls.
“Where are we going first?” he asked.
Himawari tilted her head playfully. “Hmm~ I’ll let you choose, Senpai.”
He sighed, pushing up his glasses. “Then, how about—”
“Oh! A fortune-telling booth!”
Before Kazama could react, Himawari dragged him forward.
An old lady sat behind the table, her weathered eyes filled with wisdom.
“Ah~ A lovely young couple, I see,” she said knowingly.
Kazama choked. “We’re not—”
Himawari cut him off smoothly. “Yes, yes, tell us our romantic compatibility, wise one.”
The old lady chuckled and shuffled her cards.
After a moment, she pulled out two cards and examined them.
“Oh my~ You two are quite the match.”
Kazama froze.
Himawari grinned victoriously.
“It seems the boy is a serious, responsible type, but his heart is easily swayed by the charm of a mischievous and lively girl.”
Himawari leaned in, smirking. “That sounds exactly like you, Senpai.”
Kazama’s face burned.
He stood up abruptly. “Let’s go.”
Himawari giggled, happily following him.
Score: Himawari – 1, Kazama – 0.
Pair 2 – Nene & Masao
Meanwhile, Nene and Masao stood in front of a horror house attraction.
Nene crossed her arms. “Alright, let’s get this over with.”
Masao paled. “D-Do we have to?”
“Oh? Are you scared?”
“…No.”
“Then let’s go.”
Masao regretted his life choices as soon as they entered.
The darkness, the eerie whispers, the sudden jumpscares—
It was too much.
A skeleton popped out of the wall.
Masao screamed like a banshee.
Instinctively, he grabbed onto Nene.
Nene, startled at first, was about to tease him—until she felt his grip trembling.
He was actually terrified.
For once, she didn’t mock him.
Instead, she sighed, giving his hand a small squeeze.
“…It’s okay, you big baby.”
Masao looked up, surprised.
Nene was smiling softly.
His heart did something weird.
Pair 3 – Shinchan & Ai
Ai stretched her arms, sighing in satisfaction.
“Finally! No more work! Just you and me, Shinchan~”
Shinchan yawned. “Mmm. Where to first?”
“Food!”
They spent the first part of their date (Ai insisted on calling it that) eating all kinds of festival treats.
Takoyaki. Yakisoba. Crepes. Taiyaki.
Shinchan, of course, had no shame in eating as much as possible.
Ai, meanwhile, found herself getting distracted.
He looked good.
Maybe it was the festival atmosphere, or maybe it was the way he casually leaned against a stall, sipping a soda.
Or maybe—just maybe—she was falling even harder.
“…You’re staring at me again,” Shinchan said flatly.
Ai flinched. “N-No I’m not!”
Shinchan smirked. “You totally are.”
Ai pouted. “Just eat your taiyaki.”
The Unexpected Emergency
As the day continued, the group kept exploring the festival.
Until the emergency happened.
One of the student council members ran up to Shinchan and Ai, panting.
“President! We have a problem!”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “What kind of problem?”
“The lead actors for the Romeo and Juliet play had to drop out last minute! We need replacements!”
Shinchan froze.
Ai blinked.
Then, suddenly—
A slow grin spread across her face.
“…Oh my.”
Shinchan narrowed his eyes.
“No.”
“Yes.”
“No.”
“Yes.”
Ai clapped her hands together. “Everyone! Your student council president has volunteered to play Romeo!”
The festival staff cheered.
Shinchan groaned.
And just like that—
Shinchan Nohara and Ai Suotome were cast as Romeo and Juliet.
Tomorrow would be absolute chaos.
To Be Continued in Chapter 45…

Chapter 45 – A Festival of Moments
The festival stretched before them, lively and bustling with students, teachers, parents, and guests from neighboring schools. The air carried the scent of grilled meats, fried snacks, and sweet treats, blending with the lively chatter and bursts of laughter from the festival-goers. The school grounds were transformed into a miniature city of celebration, filled with colorful booths, enthusiastic performances, and students in costumes enthusiastically advertising their class attractions.
Shinchan, Ai, Kazama, Himawari, Nene, and Masao wandered into the crowd, their excitement barely concealed. Bo, having long since accepted his solitary fate, had ventured off on his own without protest. The separation wasn’t deliberate—it just happened. One moment, he was with them, the next, he had found his own way through the crowd, calmly drifting like a leaf on a quiet stream.
As the groups unknowingly left Bo behind, he, too, enjoyed the festival at his own pace.
There was no rush, no obligations.
The art exhibit caught his attention first. Inside, the lights were dimmed, casting a gentle glow over the stunning paintings and intricate sculptures created by the students. Bo stood silently, appreciating the details—the soft strokes of a sunset painting, the careful shading of a charcoal drawing, the delicate craftsmanship of a clay figure. He spent nearly an hour there, only moving when the whispering voices around him grew too distracting.
Outside, he wandered toward the food stalls. Without hesitation, he bought a simple oden skewer, chewing in quiet contemplation as he watched the festival unfold around him.
For him, the festival was not about excitement. It was about peace.
Elsewhere, the others were not as peaceful.
——
Shinchan and Ai had somehow ended up in a goldfish scooping stall, where Ai was desperately failing.
Her fifth attempt at scooping a fish ended in disaster, as the fragile paper net tore apart the moment it touched the water.
Shinchan, standing beside her, snorted. "For someone as graceful as you pretend to be, you’re pretty bad at this."
Ai glared. "I’m letting them go. It’s called being kind."
"Uh-huh. Sure."
"Fine, then! Why don’t you try?"
Shinchan stepped up, rolling his shoulders.
With the ease of a professional, he dipped his net into the water. The surface barely rippled as he swiftly lifted the net back up, a small, wriggling goldfish trapped within.
Ai gawked.
"...You cheated."
Shinchan smirked. "How do you cheat in goldfish scooping?"
"You... you just did! I demand a rematch!"
And so began Ai’s vendetta against the goldfish, which lasted until the booth owner took pity on her and just gave her a fish.
——
Kazama and Himawari found themselves standing before a haunted house.
Kazama hesitated.
Himawari, arms crossed, eyed him smugly. "Scared?"
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Of course not. I just think it’s an inefficient use of time."
"That sounds like something a scaredy-cat would say."
Kazama huffed. Without another word, he marched inside.
Himawari, chuckling, followed.
Inside, eerie whispers echoed from hidden speakers, and shadowy figures shifted in the dim lighting. The air was thick with the artificial scent of dust and old wood, the occasional flickering of lights creating just enough unease.
Kazama walked ahead, unfazed.
Himawari, hands on her hips, was unimpressed. "Tch. Is this it? I expected more."
A hand shot out from the darkness.
She barely flinched.
Kazama, however—
"?!—"
In an instant, his hand clasped around hers.
The sudden touch made Himawari pause.
A heavy silence fell between them.
Kazama cleared his throat. "It’s just common sense to stay together in a dark place."
Himawari grinned. "Sure, Senpai."
Neither let go.
——
Meanwhile, Nene and Masao found themselves at a shooting gallery.
Nene, sleeves rolled up, grinned at the selection of prizes. "Alright, loser. Watch and learn."
Masao gulped.
She took the air rifle, aimed, and fired.
The first shot knocked down a small toy.
The second shot took down a slightly bigger prize.
By the third, the booth owner was sweating.
"Alright, I get it," Masao mumbled. "You’re good."
Nene handed him the rifle. "Your turn."
Masao hesitantly took it, positioning himself to shoot.
Nene leaned in close, her voice just by his ear. "Steady your grip."
Masao nearly dropped the rifle.
His heart thumped loudly, and for once, it wasn’t because of fear.
——
As the day continued, the group crossed paths several times, sometimes sticking together, sometimes splitting apart. They played ring toss, competed in trivia challenges, and even attempted the ridiculously difficult “test your strength” hammer game—where Shinchan won by cheating.
As the sun began to dip, the festival’s grand stage performances began.
Students gathered to watch musical acts, theatrical skits, and comedic performances. The energy of the crowd grew louder, excitement bubbling in anticipation for the night’s final performance—the dramatic play that would conclude the festival before the bonfire dance.
Shinchan and Ai, exhausted but content, finally found a moment to sit on the festival steps, watching as the sky turned orange.
Ai glanced at Shinchan, the warm glow of the sunset reflecting in her eyes.
"You know," she murmured, "this has been fun."
Shinchan smirked. "No complaints for once?"
Ai leaned against his shoulder, sighing dramatically. "I’m too tired to complain."
He chuckled but didn’t move away.
For a moment, they simply sat together, watching as the festival continued around them.
Unbeknownst to them, the final act of the festival had already begun.
And they were about to be its stars.

Chapter 46 – The Unexpected Stars of the Show
The festival was reaching its climax. The grand stage, adorned with soft golden lights and a backdrop depicting a dreamy Verona, stood at the heart of the festival grounds. The audience had begun gathering, anticipation high for the final theatrical performance—Romeo and Juliet.
Everything was going according to plan.
Until disaster struck.
Backstage, the festival organizers were losing their minds.
"He's throwing up his soul!" one of the stage crew wailed, gesturing at the unfortunate student who had been cast as Romeo. The poor boy was hunched over a trash bin, pale as a ghost, groaning as his stomach betrayed him with every second.
"Did he eat something bad?" another organizer whispered in horror.
"He challenged the Takoyaki Stall to their ‘Ultra-Spicy Hellfire Octopus’ special."
A solemn silence followed.
"Idiot," someone muttered.
The problem didn’t stop there. Juliet was missing.
"She texted saying her little brother locked her inside her house by accident! She can’t make it!"
A horrified realization settled over the group.
"WE HAVE NO LEADS!"
A frantic murmur spread through the organizers like wildfire.
In a desperate bid, one of them darted off, looking for the only people who could possibly fix this disaster—
The Student Council President and Secretary.
——
Shinchan was relaxing, sipping on a cold soda while stretching his legs backstage, when a wild, panic-stricken organizer appeared.
"PRESIDENT! SECRETARY! WE HAVE A CRISIS!"
Ai, standing beside him, raised a brow. "What now?"
"Romeo’s stomach has been turned into a warzone, and Juliet is trapped at home!"
Shinchan, sipping his drink, blinked. "...Okay, and?"
The organizer clutched his head. "WE NEED REPLACEMENTS!"
There was silence.
Then, slowly, Ai turned toward Shinchan.
Shinchan, realizing what was about to happen, started backing away.
"Ai. No."
Ai grabbed his wrist, her nails digging in. "Yes."
"No, no, no—"
"It has to be you!"
"Ai, for the love of—"
The organizer fell to his knees. "PLEASE, PRESIDENT, OUR REPUTATION AS A STUDENT COUNCIL DEPENDS ON THIS!"
Shinchan paused. He turned toward Ai, deadpan. "There’s no one else?"
Ai crossed her arms. "Would you rather it be Kazama?"
Shinchan immediately imagined Kazama playing Romeo. He shuddered.
"...Fine."
Ai grinned.
Shinchan squinted at her. "You planned this, didn’t you?"
Ai hummed. "I have no idea what you’re talking about."
——
Meanwhile, the rest of the friend group was settling into their audience seats, completely unaware of what they were about to witness.
"I heard this year’s Romeo and Juliet cast was really good," Kazama noted.
Nene stretched her arms. "Ugh, I just hope they don’t overdo the tragic part. We just had a fun festival, and I don’t wanna end it crying."
Masao nodded aggressively. "Yeah! I get emotional fast!"
Himawari, twirling a strand of hair, scoffed. "It’s Shakespeare. Of course it’s going to be dramatic."
As the curtains rose, the stage was bathed in warm lights. The audience hushed.
And then, the spotlight fell on the new Romeo and Juliet.
A beat of silence.
Then—
"WHAT THE—?!"
The entire group jerked forward in their seats.
"SHINCHAN?!"
"AI?!"
Masao nearly choked. "SINCE WHEN WERE THEY IN THE PLAY?!"
Nene’s jaw dropped. "I—I DIDN’T KNOW THEY COULD ACT?!"
Kazama adjusted his glasses, squinting at the stage. "This is... unexpected."
Himawari covered her mouth. "Oh, this is going to be good."
——
Onstage, Shinchan was suffering.
He was dressed in a classic Romeo costume—a white flowy shirt, fitted vest, and ridiculous puffy pants. Ai, on the other hand, looked stunning in a delicate, flowing Juliet gown, her long hair curled in elegant waves.
"Dear Juliet," Shinchan began, his expression completely flat.
The audience erupted into muffled laughter.
Ai, ever the professional, lifted a delicate hand toward him. "Oh, my dearest Romeo! Dost thou profess thy love for me under this very moon?"
Shinchan, dead inside, let out an exaggerated sigh. "Yeah, sure. Thou art, like, really pretty."
The crowd cracked up.
From the audience, Kazama pinched his forehead. "Oh god, he’s butchering Shakespeare."
Nene, crying with laughter, shook Masao’s shoulders. "WE'RE WITNESSING HISTORY!"
Ai, still in character, took a deep breath. "Oh, fair Romeo! But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?"
Shinchan, deadpan, gestured toward the stage lights. "That light. Right there."
The audience exploded.
But then—
Ai stepped forward.
She lifted a hand to Shinchan’s cheek, softly.
"Romeo," she whispered, her voice tender.
Shinchan froze.
The play continued, but something shifted.
For a brief moment, Ai’s gaze held genuine emotion.
Shinchan, caught off guard, felt his heart skip a beat.
The moment was small—but real.
——
Suddenly, mid-scene, Shinchan’s eyes darted toward the audience.
And there he was.
Kazama.
Sitting suspiciously close to Himawari.
Shinchan’s eyelid twitched.
‘No. Absolutely not. I’m dealing with this later.’
The play continued as the audience enjoyed every second of Romeo and Juliet's most chaotic performance in history.
——
The final act ended with an explosion of applause.
As the curtains fell, Shinchan exhaled. "Well. That happened."
Ai smirked. "You weren’t bad."
Shinchan scoffed. "I carried that play."
They stepped backstage—only for the group to immediately pounce on them.
"YOU TWO WERE AMAZING!" Masao sobbed. "I—I ALMOST BELIEVED YOU WERE REALLY IN LOVE!"
Nene, grinning, elbowed Ai. "Didn’t know you had that in you."
Ai simply shrugged, smug.
Kazama, arms crossed, nodded. "Impressive. Although, the Shakespeare purist in me is screaming."
Himawari tilted her head. "Shinchan? You okay?"
Shinchan turned to Kazama.
Kazama, blinking, suddenly felt a chill.
Shinchan grinned. "Oi, Kazama. Let’s talk."
Kazama gulped.
Himawari’s eyes widened. "W-Wait, what?!"
Nene and Masao gasped.
Bo, who had just arrived, sipped his drink. "Oh. This’ll be fun."

Chapter 47 – The Overprotective Brother and a Festival Night
Kazama was sweating.
The rest of the group had already started walking ahead, chatting about the festival, their laughter echoing through the night air. But Kazama? He was trapped.
Shinchan had his arm wrapped around Kazama’s shoulders, his grip oddly firm.
"Oi, Kazama~," Shinchan drawled, voice dangerously sweet.
Kazama swallowed hard. "W-What?"
"Having fun with my little sister?"
Kazama felt a bead of sweat roll down his temple. "I—W-We were just watching the play together."
Shinchan nodded. "Uh-huh. And?"
Kazama winced. "And... enjoying the festival together?"
"Uh-huh. And?"
Kazama stared at him, panicked. "There is no ‘and!’"
Shinchan’s smile didn’t waver. "Kazama, buddy, pal... We’ve known each other for years, right?"
Kazama nodded rapidly. "Yeah! Yeah, of course!"
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. "Then you understand that I, as an older brother, need to ensure that my dear, innocent, beloved Hima-chan is treated with the utmost respect, yes?"
Kazama frantically nodded. "I-I have nothing but respect for her!"
Shinchan grinned. "Good. Good. That’s what I like to hear."
Kazama sighed in relief—only to immediately tense as Shinchan leaned in and whispered into his ear.
"But if I ever hear her blushes because of you... we’re going to have a very long talk."
Kazama felt his soul leave his body.
Himawari, standing a few steps away, facepalmed. "Onii-san. Please."
Masao and Nene were crying with laughter.
Bo just nodded in approval.
"Alright, alright," Ai finally stepped in, pulling Shinchan away from Kazama before the poor boy could keel over from fear. "That’s enough. You’re being ridiculous."
Shinchan sighed dramatically. "Fine, fine. I’ll allow it. For now."
Himawari rolled her eyes. "You are so embarrassing."
Shinchan beamed. "That’s my job!"
——
They finally headed home, the warm glow of the streetlights illuminating their way.
Shinchan stretched his arms, letting out a relaxed sigh. "Man, what a day."
Misae, hearing them enter, peeked out from the kitchen. "Oh, you’re home! How was the festival?"
Hiroshi, sitting at the table with a beer, grinned. "You kids enjoy yourselves?"
Himawari huffed. "I did—until Onii-san decided to act like a caveman."
Misae raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What did he do now?"
Himawari pointed at Shinchan. "He tried to interrogate Kazama just because we watched the festival together!"
Hiroshi choked on his drink. "Pfft—Oh man, you actually did it?!"
Misae sighed. "Honestly, Shin. You are so—"
"Oi, Oi, Oi." Shinchan grinned, cutting her off. "I was just doing my duty as an older brother. Making sure my dear baby sister is in safe hands~"
Himawari twitched. "I am not a baby!"
Shinchan turned to Hiroshi, mock gasping. "Dad! She’s growing up so fast! Next thing you know, she’ll be running off with Kazama to get married!"
Himawari turned red. "Onii-SAN!"
Misae chuckled. "Well, she is at that age, after all."
Himawari gasped, betrayed. "Mom?! Not you too!"
Hiroshi wiped a fake tear. "Ahh... First Ai-chan, now Hima-chan... My little kids are growing up..."
Shinchan perked up at that.
Ai-chan.
Before he could stop it, a memory flickered through his mind.
——
The soft touch of her hand against his cheek.
Her voice, whispering "Romeo."
The flicker of something in her eyes—something that felt... too real.
——
His heart skipped a beat.
Shinchan blinked rapidly.
The hell?
Himawari, still fuming, suddenly smirked.
"Well, Onii-san," she said sweetly. "Speaking of growing up... What about you and Ai-chan, huh?"
Shinchan snapped out of it. "What?"
Himawari grinned. "You two looked awfully comfortable on stage today~."
Shinchan scoffed. "It was a play, genius."
Misae giggled. "Oh, but it was a very romantic play. You two made a great couple~"
Hiroshi snorted. "Man, I should’ve recorded it."
Shinchan groaned. "You guys are ridiculous."
Himawari leaned forward, smirking. "Oh? You’re blushing."
Shinchan pointed at her. "Lies."
Himawari grinned. "I bet Ai-chan was thinking about it too~."
Shinchan froze for a second.
Then, with an exaggerated yawn, he stood up. "Welp! That’s enough of this conversation! Time for a bath, then sleep! Goodnight, everyone!"
Misae, laughing, waved him off. "Alright, alright. Sleep well."
Himawari just smirked.
——
In the bath, steam curling around him, Shinchan leaned back, eyes half-lidded.
The memory returned.
Ai’s hand.
The soft whisper of his name.
His own heart skipping a beat.
"...Tch." He closed his eyes, shaking his head.
"Not happening."
But still, even as he sank deeper into the warm water—
The feeling lingered.

Chapter 48 – Progress, Change, and an Unwanted Invitation
The festival had ended, but the changes it left behind lingered.
At school, things were different now.
——
"Oi, Masao," Nene grinned, nudging him during lunch. "Are you free this weekend?"
Masao paused mid-bite, blinking. "Huh? W-Why?"
Nene smirked. "Just wondering if you wanted to check out that new arcade with me."
Masao nearly choked.
"With you? Alone?"
Nene rolled her eyes. "Yes, alone. Do you have a problem with that?"
Masao frantically shook his head. "N-No! Not at all!"
Nene raised an eyebrow. "Then why do you look like you’re about to faint?"
Masao, face red as a tomato, nervously sipped his drink.
Bo, sitting beside him, just patted his shoulder in silent support.
——
Meanwhile, Kazama was having a crisis of his own.
"Are you okay?" Ai asked, looking at him with mild concern.
Kazama sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I don’t understand it."
"Understand what?"
He frowned. "Why does it feel like everyone around me is suddenly acting different after the festival?"
Ai smirked. "Because things are different, Kazama. People grew closer."
Kazama muttered under his breath, glancing at Masao and Nene.
"And some people grew too close."
Ai chuckled. "You sound jealous."
Kazama scoffed. "Hardly. I just—" He paused, then groaned. "I don’t know. It’s weird."
Ai tilted her head. "And what about you?"
Kazama blinked. "What about me?"
Ai smiled knowingly. "Anything... new happening in your life?"
Kazama coughed. "No. Absolutely nothing."
Ai’s smirk widened. "Mmm-hmm. Sure."
——
And then there was Shinchan.
He was chilling.
Feet kicked up on his desk, completely at ease despite the newfound tension in the air.
"Man," he sighed, "love is in the air, huh?"
Ai, smirking, leaned on his desk. "And what about you?"
Shinchan shrugged. "No clue what you mean."
Ai narrowed her eyes. "Really now?"
Shinchan grinned. "Yup! No thoughts, head empty."
Ai stared at him, before shaking her head in disbelief.
——
But of course, peace never lasted.
Because just before lunch ended, the door to their classroom slammed open.
"SHINNOSUKE NOHARA!"
Shinchan blinked. "Huh?"
The whole class turned to the doorway, where Rika Miyamoto, the vice-captain of the Kendo Club, stood with her arms crossed.
Shinchan pointed at himself. "Me?"
"Yes, you." She walked up, her gaze sharp. "We need to talk."
Kazama frowned. "What is this about?"
She ignored him, staring straight at Shinchan.
"We need an extra person for the competition in two months."
Shinchan froze.
The air changed.
For a moment, the usual lazy mischief in his eyes flickered.
Ai, who had been watching him the whole time, noticed it immediately.
"Sorry, but I quit Kendo years ago," Shinchan finally said, shrugging. "Not interested."
Rika scowled. "You don’t have a choice. We’re desperate. The club needs you."
"Not my problem."
Ai narrowed her eyes. "Shin..."
Rika stepped forward. "Look, I know you’re not the type to take things seriously. But you’re still Shinnosuke Nohara. The same one who was once called a genius."
Shinchan tensed.
"But you ran away, didn’t you?" Rika continued. "Why?"
The whole classroom was silent.
Shinchan’s expression didn’t change. He leaned back, completely unreadable.
"Because I didn’t care anymore," he said simply.
Rika clenched her fists. "Liar."
Shinchan just grinned. "Believe what you want."
Rika exhaled sharply, clearly frustrated. "At least think about it. We’re holding tryouts tomorrow. If you show up, good. If you don’t, then... I guess you really don’t care."
And with that, she turned and stormed out.
The classroom remained silent for a moment before Ai broke it.
"You’re thinking about it, aren’t you?"
Shinchan laughed. "Nope. Not even a little."
Ai stared at him.
Then smirked.
"You’ll be there."
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "Oh? That confident?"
Ai just smiled.
"Yup."

Chapter 49 – The Reluctant Genius and the Forgotten Dojo
Shinchan had never been one to feel pressured.
No matter what people said, no matter what they expected of him, he always shrugged it off.
But today...
Today was different.
——
“Come on, Shinchan! Just try it out!”
Ai walked beside him, hands on her hips, her eyes sharp with determination.
Kazama nodded firmly from his other side. “It’s a simple solution. You join the tryouts, give it a shot, and if you still don’t want to do it, we’ll drop it.”
Nene, Masao, and Bo all walked ahead, but their ears were clearly tuned in.
“I already said no,” Shinchan muttered.
“You say no to everything,” Ai huffed. “But that doesn’t mean you actually mean it.”
Shinchan smirked. “Wow, it’s almost like you know me.”
Ai rolled her eyes. “I do.”
Kazama, ever the logical one, adjusted his glasses. “Think about it, Shinchan. We’re not asking you to join the club. Just one match. One competition.”
Shinchan stopped walking.
The others took a few more steps before noticing and turning back.
“No.”
The tone was different this time.
More firm.
More final.
Ai’s eyes widened slightly.
Kazama looked surprised.
Even Nene, Masao, and Bo—who had been eavesdropping—paused.
Shinchan stretched, grinning. “I already gave up on Kendo. No need to dig up the past.”
Ai narrowed her eyes. That was a lie.
But before she could say anything, Shinchan waved.
“Welp! It’s been fun, but I’m heading home. Later!”
And just like that, he walked away, ignoring their stares.
——
But even after leaving them behind, their words stayed.
They sat at the back of his mind, clawing at him.
By the time he was nearing home, his steps slowed.
His street came into view. The familiar buildings, the usual warmth of his home just a few steps away.
But instead of turning right...
He stopped.
Then, without thinking, his legs moved in the opposite direction.
Down the old path.
Past the shops.
Through the alleyways.
Until he stood in front of a run-down dojo.
His old Kendo dojo.
It hadn’t changed.
The wooden sign was still chipped. The doors still creaked. The place still smelled like old tatami mats and sweat.
And just like always, inside sat an old man.
His former sensei.
The man didn’t even look up.
“You finally grew a brain and came back, huh?”
Shinchan sighed, stepping inside.
“Not exactly, old man.”
The sensei snorted.
“Well, that’s disappointing.”

Chapter 50 – The Blade and the Past
Shinchan’s foot hovered for a second before he lightly stepped over the broken floorboard.
It looked fine, but he knew better.
The place hadn’t changed at all.
Neither had his sensei.
Shinchan walked to the familiar wooden bench, letting out a small sigh as he sat down.
He didn’t speak.
And neither did his sensei.
The old man continued sipping his tea, as if he hadn’t just received an unexpected guest after all these years.
Minutes passed.
Shinchan picked at his sleeve, then at a loose thread in his pants. His sensei continued drinking, eyes closed, like some mystical old sage.
Still, neither spoke.
Until—
Something flew at him.
A bokken.
Shinchan barely had time to lift his hand before catching it mid-air.
At the same time, his sensei tossed a set of protective gear at his feet.
“Gear up.”
Shinchan stared at the sword in his hand. It felt heavier than he remembered.
He glanced at his sensei.
The old man had already stood up.
His sleeves rolled back.
His eyes sharp.
Shinchan sighed, dragging the gear toward him.
“So, no warm-up talk?”
His sensei smirked.
“The fight is the talk.”
Shinchan couldn’t help but grin.
Some things really never changed.

Chapter 51 – The Clash of the Past and Present
Thud.
Shinchan’s hand tightened around the bokken’s hilt as he fastened the last strap of his protective gear.
His sensei stood across from him, feet planted firmly, his own bokken resting lightly against his shoulder.
The air inside the old dojo felt still.
Dust particles floated in the light streaming through the wooden slats, caught in the quiet tension between master and student.
Shinchan rolled his shoulders, loosening his stance. It had been years. He wasn’t even sure how much of his old self remained in his swordplay.
His sensei simply adjusted his grip.
“We begin.”
No countdown. No signal.
Just instant motion.
His sensei lunged first.
Shinchan’s muscles reacted before his brain did. A diagonal slash came down—fast.
Too fast.
Shinchan barely twisted his sword to deflect it. His hands stung from the impact as his feet slid back across the smooth wooden floor.
No time to breathe.
Another strike.
Shinchan leaned left. The bokken whistled past his ear.
A third strike.
A feint.
Shinchan realized too late. His sensei’s blade pulled back—then struck the side of his ribs.
A sharp thud.
Shinchan exhaled sharply, stepping back.
His sensei didn’t give him a moment to reset.
A relentless flurry followed—strike after strike, leaving Shinchan with barely enough time to block, dodge, and counter where he could.
But his sensei was too strong.
Shinchan ducked, twisted, blocked. Each attack was like a storm, each parry draining more from him.
This isn’t working.
His bokken trembled under the pressure of his defense.
He had to do something different.
He had to—
Think.
Memory hit him like a sword to the chest.
——
Kindergarten.
The competition.
He had cut through his opponents effortlessly.
Every match, every strike—it had been natural.
Fast.
He reached the finals.
People expected him to win.
But he didn’t.
Because he gave up.
He dropped his sword before the match even started.
"Eh, I’m bored," he had said.
A shrug. A laugh.
A lie.
His sensei knew.
But no one else did.
He remembered Kazama’s stunned face in the audience, the way his opponent just stood there, confused.
He had thrown it away.
For what?
To not take it seriously?
Because winning didn’t matter?
Or because…
It did?
——
Shinchan snapped back to the present.
His sensei was already mid-strike—
This time, Shinchan met it head-on.
A loud crack echoed through the dojo.
Their swords clashed, neither one giving ground.
But for the first time in years, Shinchan’s grip didn’t waver.
For the first time, he didn’t just dodge. He didn’t just defend.
He fought.

Chapter 52 – The Storm of Blades
The crack of wood meeting wood rang through the dojo.
Shinchan’s grip tightened around the hilt of his bokken, his feet digging into the smooth wooden floor as he met his sensei’s downward strike head-on.
For the first time in years, he wasn’t just deflecting.
He was standing his ground.
His sensei pushed down harder, their swords locked in place. The pressure vibrated through Shinchan’s arms, but he refused to let go.
Then, without warning—his sensei twisted his wrist.
Shinchan’s bokken slipped slightly.
A trap.
His sensei’s sword suddenly disappeared from his sight—only to reappear inches from his side.
A strike.
Too late.
Shinchan tried to pivot, but the bokken slammed into his ribs.
A sharp thud.
Shinchan staggered back, breath caught in his throat. His entire side burned.
His sensei didn’t slow down.
Another swing.
Shinchan barely managed to parry, the force making his fingers sting.
This isn’t working.
He had to stop reacting. He had to—
Attack.
Shinchan dropped low, twisting his body.
A sudden side swing.
His sensei took a step back, barely dodging.
For the first time in the match—
Shinchan went on the offensive.
His bokken slashed forward—once, twice—fluid, unpredictable.
His sensei deflected the strikes, but Shinchan pressed on.
Each step, each attack, felt like muscle memory reawakening.
The years of buried training resurfaced.
He wasn’t a child anymore.
This wasn’t a game.
He wasn’t going to drop his sword.
Not this time.
Their bokken clashed again, the force sending a gust of wind through the dojo.
Shinchan smirked.
His sensei raised an eyebrow.
And just like that—
The fight continued.
——
Chapter 53 – Stepping Forward
Shinchan winced.
His body hurt.
His legs felt like bricks. His arms ached. His ribs were still sore from last night’s fight.
And yet—
As he walked through the school gates the next morning, he felt…
Lighter.
He had spent all night thinking.
Thinking about the match.
Thinking about how his body moved before his mind did.
Thinking about how he hadn’t hesitated.
Thinking about how, for the first time in years, he wanted to fight.
The answer had been obvious from the start.
He sighed, stuffing his hands into his pockets as he walked through the hallway.
The Kendo Club room wasn’t far.
A few students passed him, chatting about whatever high school drama was popular today.
Some first-years looked at him, whispering about the student council president aimlessly wandering toward the club rooms.
Shinchan ignored them.
He stopped in front of the Kendo Club’s sliding door.
He could already hear the sounds of practice inside—shouts, wooden swords clashing.
He exhaled through his nose.
Time to get this over with.
With a smooth push, he slid the door open.
The club members froze.
A few of them whipped their heads around.
Some whispers. Some murmurs.
Then—
A familiar voice called out.
“Well, well.”
Shinchan looked ahead.
Rika Miyamoto.
The vice-captain.
And the girl who had seen him in a maid outfit.
She crossed her arms, smirking. “Didn’t expect to see you here, Student Council President.”
Shinchan blinked.
Then, with a perfectly straight face—
“Me neither.”

The moment Shinchan walked into class, he knew something was wrong.
Not in the dangerous way.
In the annoying way.
The classroom was buzzing.
People were whispering, staring, pointing.
It was like he had grown a second head overnight.
He sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. Didn’t think news would spread this fast.
He barely made it to his seat when—
“SHINCHAN!!!”
A blur of movement.
Suddenly, his entire friend group was at his desk.
Kazama looked genuinely shocked.
Masao was shaking.
Bo nodded slowly, like he knew all along.
And Nene?
She had her hands on her hips, eyes narrowed.
“What. Did. You. Do.”
Shinchan blinked.
“…I gave my name for the Kendo tournament.”
The group collectively exploded.
Kazama grabbed his shoulders. “You—WHAT?!”
Masao looked like he was about to faint. “H-Hey! What happened to ‘I’ll never go back’?!”
Nene slammed a hand on his desk. “Did they threaten you?! Was there blackmail?!”
Bo gave a slow thumbs-up. “Good choice.”
Shinchan sighed, leaning back in his chair. “It’s not that big of a deal, guys.”
Kazama stared at him. “Not that big of a deal?! Shinchan, you’ve been avoiding Kendo for YEARS.”
Shinchan scratched his cheek. “Yeah, well. People change.”
That only made them more suspicious.
“Wait…” Nene narrowed her eyes. “Don’t tell me—”
She gasped.
A dramatic pause.
“Did Ai-chan convince you?!”
The group froze.
Then all of them slowly turned to him.
Shinchan sighed.
He was too tired for this.

Chapter 55 – The School Watches
Shinchan let out a sigh.
They weren’t letting this go, were they?
Ever since he had casually dropped the bomb that he was joining the Kendo competition, his friends had been eyeing him like he was a rare animal in a zoo.
And now, Ai had joined in.
Though unlike the others, who were buzzing with questions and conspiracies, Ai had a different approach.
She just stood next to him, smiling.
Not saying a word.
Just watching.
Like she was waiting for something.
It was unsettling.
“…What?” he finally asked.
Ai tilted her head, looking up at him.
“I was just wondering how you’d handle all this attention~” she hummed, twirling a strand of her hair. “Everyone’s talking about you today, you know.”
“I noticed,” Shinchan muttered.
Kazama leaned in. “So, are you gonna tell us why?”
“Yeah!” Masao added. “You never wanted to do Kendo again. What changed?”
Nene crossed her arms. “You definitely got brainwashed.”
Shinchan groaned. “You guys are acting like I joined a cult.”
“You kinda did.”
He shot Kazama a look. “Not helping.”
Ai finally spoke up. “I didn’t do anything, you know.”
The group turned to her.
“What?” Nene asked.
Ai smiled. “I didn’t convince him or push him into it. This was all Shinchan’s decision.”
For some reason, that only made the group MORE confused.
Kazama narrowed his eyes. “You’re saying… he did this on his own?”
“Yes.”
“…Without anyone forcing him?”
“Mhm.”
Masao looked stunned. “Then why does this feel even weirder?”
——
The Day of Observation
The rest of the day was chaos.
Because his friends didn’t believe him.
Or rather, they were convinced something had to have happened to make him change his mind.
So what did they do?
They watched him.
Closely.
For the entire day.
It was like being in a poorly made spy movie.
If he reached for his lunch?
They took notes.
If he stretched his arms?
They whispered to each other like it was a clue.
If he yawned?
Nene nodded like she had figured something out.
“…Guys,” Shinchan sighed as he ate. “You’re acting like I’m a suspect in a murder case.”
“We’re just trying to see what changed,” Kazama said, staring hard. “You always had talent, but you never cared. So why now?”
Ai just giggled. “This is fun~”
——
Afternoon – The Big Moment
By the time school ended, everyone had heard about Shinchan rejoining Kendo.
Which meant when he headed toward the Kendo clubroom for practice—
Half the school was following him.
Seriously.
It started with just his friends.
Then a few classmates joined in.
Then students from other years.
By the time he actually reached the Kendo hall—
There was an entire crowd.
“…What the hell?”
Shinchan stared.
So many people.
Some were from sports clubs.
Some were Kendo members from other schools.
Some were just curious students who wanted to see ‘the lazy genius’ in action.
And in the middle of them—
Rika Miyamoto, the Kendo club’s vice-captain, looking extremely smug.
“Well, well,” she said, stepping forward. “Looks like the legendary prodigy is back.”
Shinchan scratched his head. “Man, you guys love throwing around the word ‘legendary’ too much.”
“Oh?” Rika smirked. “Then why don’t you prove us wrong?”
She tossed him a shinai.
“Let’s see what you’ve got.”

Chapter 56 – The Fight That Left Everyone in Awe
Shinchan stood in the center of the Kendo hall, shinai in hand, as the weight of countless eyes pressed down on him.
The crowd had grown even bigger.
People were whispering, betting, watching.
Even Kazama, Nene, Masao, Bo-chan, and Ai had settled in at the front, eager to see what was about to happen.
At the other end of the hall stood Rika Miyamoto.
The vice-captain of the Kendo club.
And she looked dangerous.
Her stance was perfect, her aura sharp.
But she wasn’t being reckless.
No.
She was testing him.
She wanted to see if he was still the Shinchan of old.
The prodigy who never cared.
Shinchan sighed.
"Alright," he muttered, lowering his body into a stance. "Let's get this over with."
——
The First Strike
The second the match began—
Rika moved.
Fast.
Her feet barely touched the ground as she closed the distance, her shinai cutting through the air like a whip.
"MEN!"
The entire room flinched.
She was fast.
And brutal.
But—
CLASH!
The impact of their blades shook the hall.
Shinchan had blocked.
Casually.
Like it was nothing.
His body hadn’t even moved.
It was like his reflexes had taken over before his brain even registered the attack.
A shiver ran down Rika’s spine.
This guy—
He was still sharp.
——
A Different Kind of Shinchan
But something felt off.
The Shinchan she had heard about was a genius.
A natural fighter.
But he was also someone who never took things seriously.
So why was she getting the feeling—
That he was actually thinking?
That he was actually trying?
Rika lunged again.
Shinchan deflected.
She twisted her body, going low for a strike.
Shinchan stepped back just in time.
The crowd watched in stunned silence.
No wasted movements.
No openings.
He wasn’t just dodging.
He was reading her.
Like he was figuring her out mid-fight.
——
A Past That Lingered
As he fought, memories surfaced.
Of that final match in kindergarten.
When he had reached the finals.
When everyone had expected him to win.
But instead—
He had dropped his sword.
And walked away.
Not because he was scared.
Not because he was tired.
But because he didn’t care.
The crowd had been confused.
The teachers had been furious.
And the other kid?
The one who won by default?
He had been furious, too.
“What the hell was that?!”
“Why did you give up?!”
“That was an insult to me! To everyone who fought their hardest to get here!”
But Shinchan hadn’t cared.
Because winning or losing never mattered to him.
Back then, he had thought—
It’s just a game.
Why does it matter?
——
Now… It Mattered.
Rika came in with a powerful downward slash.
Shinchan ducked.
She spun, striking at his side.
Shinchan parried.
She jumped back, panting.
That’s when she realized—
She hadn’t landed a single hit.
Not one.
The crowd was silent.
Everyone was holding their breath.
Because they could see it now.
This wasn’t luck.
This wasn’t fluke.
Shinchan wasn’t just talented.
He was dangerous.
And for the first time, he wasn’t holding back.

Chapter 58 – The First and Last Strike
Shinchan’s stance hadn’t changed.
His grip on the shinai was relaxed.
His expression?
Still lazy.
But—
His eyes.
For the first time, his friends saw it.
Determination.
——
A Defensive Wall
Rika attacked again.
Faster. Stronger.
She wasn’t holding back anymore.
Her shinai became a blur, striking from every angle.
Right!
 Left!
 Low!
 High!
But every single strike was blocked.
Shinchan’s movements were almost bored, like he had all the time in the world.
Like he was toying with her.
Rika gritted her teeth.
Is he just messing around?!
She knew she was one of the strongest fighters in the club.
She had fought plenty of skilled opponents before.
But this—
This was different.
Shinchan wasn’t just reacting.
He was controlling the match.
Without attacking even once.
And somehow, that was even more infuriating.
——
The Moment It Ended
Then, it happened.
A single moment of hesitation.
Rika’s foot slid just a little too far.
A tiny opening.
And in that instant—
Shinchan moved.
——
The entire dojo froze.
——
A single step forward.
A shift in weight.
And then—
CRACK!
His shinai sliced through the air.
Fast. Precise.
Too fast for Rika to even react.
"MEN!"
A perfect strike to the headgear.
A sound so loud it echoed through the hall.
Rika’s body locked up—
Then stumbled back.
The match was over.
With a single attack.
——
The Aftermath
Silence.
Then—
"… What the hell just happened?"
"Did he just… win in one hit?"
"Bro was playing defense the whole time and then—"
"Yo. That was kinda scary."
The whispers spread like wildfire.
The entire school had just witnessed something insane.
Ai, Nene, Masao, Bo, and Kazama were still staring.
They had always seen Shinchan as a lazy, carefree idiot.
But this?
They didn’t know this Shinchan.
——
Rika's Shock
Rika stood still, breathing heavily.
She had lost.
Not because she wasn’t strong.
But because she had never even stood a chance.
Her fingers clenched around her shinai.
"You…" she said, looking at him. "Why do you fight like that?"
Shinchan blinked.
"Like what?"
"Like… Like you don’t care. But at the same time, like you’re in complete control."
Shinchan scratched his cheek, looking away.
"Uh. Habit?"
Rika stared at him.
Then—
She sighed.
And laughed.
——
The Legend Begins
By the time the match ended, the school was in chaos.
Rumors were already spreading.
"He’s insane."
"Bro was playing around and still won."
"Who even is this guy?"
But Shinchan?
He just grabbed his bag and walked off.
His friends ran after him, still trying to process what they had just seen.
Kazama put a hand on Shinchan’s shoulder.
"… You’ve been hiding this from us?"
Shinchan grinned.
"Nah. You guys just never asked."
Ai smacked his arm.
"That’s not how that works, you idiot!"
The group started walking back together.
And for the first time, Shinchan felt it.
Something shifted.
This time, he wasn’t walking away.
This time, he was moving forward.

Week 1 – The First Routine
Shinchan's life shifted.
Every day after school, he went to the Kendo Club.
Every weekend, he trained at his old dojo.
It was weird.
Routine wasn’t exactly his thing.
But somehow—
He found himself enjoying it.

The School’s Reaction
The school was still talking about his fight with Rika.
“Yo, that’s the Kendo guy, right?”
“Did you hear? He’s been training every day now.”
“Wait, wait. Are we talking about the Shinchan? The one who used to sleep in class?”
Rumors kept spreading.
His name was suddenly everywhere.
People watched when he walked to the clubroom.
Even students who never cared about Kendo were suddenly invested.
It was…
Annoying.
But also… kinda fun?

His Friends’ Reaction
His friends were the worst, though.
Ai kept smirking at him.
"You’re actually working hard. Who are you?"
Kazama looked at him suspiciously.
"Have you been kidnapped? Blink twice if you need help."
Masao and Bo didn't say much—
But Nene?
She was loving every second.
"You better win, Shin-chan! Or else!"

—
At first, it was just something the others had pushed him into. He had no real intention of committing to it. The idea of training every day, swinging a wooden sword like some ancient warrior, seemed like too much effort for too little reward. But after that first fight with Rika, after feeling the weight of the shinai in his hands again, something inside him had shifted.
He still wasn’t sure what it was.
Every day after school, he walked to the Kendo Club. Every weekend, he found himself at the old dojo, facing his old sensei, stepping across the same creaky wooden floor he had once abandoned. His hands, once only used for flipping through manga or reaching for snacks, now bore the marks of callouses from gripping the shinai. His body, which had been used to lazy slouches and half-hearted movements, was beginning to move with precision.
The school noticed. They always did.
“Yo, that’s the Kendo guy, right?”
“Did you hear? He’s been training every day now.”
“Wait, wait. Are we talking about the Shinchan? The one who used to sleep in class?”
It wasn’t just the students who watched him. Even some of the teachers, who had long since given up on seeing him take anything seriously, looked at him differently. Some were surprised. Some were curious. Some just looked concerned, as if this sudden dedication was a sign of the apocalypse.
His friends, of course, were the worst.
Ai was the first to say something.
"You’re actually working hard. Who are you?"
Kazama squinted at him as if trying to solve some unsolvable equation. "Have you been kidnapped? Blink twice if you need help."
Masao and Bo didn’t say much, though Masao sometimes watched him with something close to admiration. But Nene? She was having the time of her life.
"You better win, Shin-chan! Or else!"
She never actually said what or else meant, but her smile was threatening enough.
Even at home, things were different.
Himawari had a smug look on her face every time he came back exhausted. She’d twirl her hair and smirk at him like she was the older sibling. "Ara, ara, Shin-nii, you’re actually working hard? Should I be worried?"
His mom, of course, was proud. She bragged about him to anyone who would listen. “My Shin-chan is training for a competition, you know! He’s really amazing when he puts his mind to something!”
His dad just nodded. "Good. A man should know how to swing a sword properly."
And yet, despite all this—despite the changes in how people looked at him—Shinchan himself wasn’t entirely sure why he kept going back.
Maybe it was the way his heart pounded when he held the shinai.
Maybe it was the sound of wood clashing against wood, echoing through the dojo.
Maybe it was the challenge—the way every step forward reminded him of who he used to be, and who he could be if he wanted to.
Or maybe… maybe it was just fun.
Whatever the reason, he didn’t stop.
Not even once.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 61 – A Week Before the Match
The dojo smelled of old wood, sweat, and memories.
The floor creaked under Shinchan’s movements as he took his stance, gripping the shinai tightly. His breath was steady, his focus sharp, but his body—his body felt like it had been run over by a truck.
His sensei stood before him, the ever-intimidating presence he had known since childhood, watching with that unreadable expression. It had been two months of relentless training. The weight of the shinai no longer felt unfamiliar, his footwork had become second nature, and his reaction speed had improved to the point where he could deflect strikes without thinking.
And yet—
I’m a mess.
His muscles ached. His hands were covered in blisters despite the callouses. His brain felt fried from balancing Kendo, schoolwork, and the student council. It was a miracle he hadn’t collapsed already.
"You're slowing down," his sensei commented, swinging at him. Shinchan barely blocked in time. The impact jolted through his arms, and he staggered back, panting.
"Oi, oi, where’s all that fire from before?" his sensei teased.
"Burnt out," Shinchan muttered, pushing forward again. He aimed a strike at his sensei’s side, but it was easily deflected. Another blow came at him, fast and sharp, but he ducked at the last second, countering with a sudden thrust.
His sensei blocked it with ease. "Better. But not good enough."
Shinchan smirked, but inside, he was exhausted.
—
By the time he left the dojo, it was late. The sky was tinged with orange and purple, the sun dipping below the horizon. His uniform was drenched in sweat, his shinai slung over his shoulder as he trudged back home.
But his day wasn’t over.
As soon as he stepped into his house, his mom called, "Shin-chan! The student council meeting is in thirty minutes, right?"
Right.
Student council.
He groaned but grabbed his bag and left.
—
The meeting room was filled with papers, whiteboards covered in scribbles, and the faint scent of desperation. The school festival might have been over, but the council still had a mountain of work. Upcoming events, budget allocations, club requests—it never ended.
And in the middle of it all was Shinchan, slouched in his chair, barely paying attention as Ai went through the agenda.
"Shin-chan," Ai called.
He blinked. "Huh?"
She sighed. "I said, do you approve this budget request?"
"...Sure."
Ai narrowed her eyes. "You didn’t even look at it."
"Do you want me to look at it?"
She exhaled, rubbing her temples. "You’re impossible."
"Yup." He grinned lazily but quickly winced as his back ached from the day’s training.
Kazama, who had been quietly observing him, finally spoke up. "Shinchan. You look terrible."
"Thanks," Shinchan said dryly.
"No, seriously." Kazama frowned. "You’ve been running around non-stop. Student council, Kendo, school—you can’t keep this up."
Ai crossed her arms, looking concerned now. "Kazama’s right. You’re barely functioning at this point. Are you even getting enough sleep?"
Shinchan leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. "Eh, sleep is for the weak."
"You're going to die before the match," Kazama deadpanned.
There was a beat of silence before Ai said, softer this time, "Why are you pushing yourself so hard?"
Shinchan didn’t answer immediately. He tapped his fingers against the table, thinking. He could brush it off with a joke, pretend like it didn’t matter. But as he sat there, feeling their concerned stares, he sighed.
"...I don’t know," he admitted. "Maybe I just want to see how far I can go."
Kazama’s expression shifted, and Ai’s eyes softened.
"Then don’t do it alone," Ai said. "You have us, you idiot."
Shinchan smirked, but something about her words settled inside him.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "If you collapse before the match, it’s over. So, from now on, we’re making sure you don’t overdo it."
Shinchan snorted. "So, what? Are you guys my babysitters now?"
Kazama looked unimpressed. "If that’s what it takes."
Ai smiled. "Exactly."
Shinchan stared at them for a moment before chuckling. "...You guys are annoying."
"But you love us," Ai shot back.
Shinchan didn’t respond, but the small grin on his face said enough.
With only a week left before the match, he had no idea how things would turn out.
But at least he wasn’t alone.

Chapter 63 – The Return of the Prodigy
The venue was massive. Banners hung from the railings, the polished wooden floor reflecting the bright lights overhead. Rows upon rows of seats were filled with spectators—students, parents, teachers, and other competitors from different schools. The tension in the air was thick, but amidst the anticipation, murmurs spread like wildfire.
"That kid—"
"Did you hear? That Shin Nohara is participating?"
"You mean that one? The kindergarten finals dropout?"
"Wait, what happened?"
"You don’t know? He reached the finals years ago and just gave up without a fight! He was insane back then—he could’ve won! But he just... threw it away!"
"No way… And he’s back now?"
The whispers only grew louder when the proctor for the exam—a middle-aged man with sharp eyes and an air of authority—finally noticed the name on the roster.
Nohara Shin…
His gaze snapped to the participant standing in the line with his school’s Kendo team. There was no mistaking it.
It’s him.
He had been there all those years ago, watching as a five-year-old boy dominated the competition, reached the final round, and—
—laughed, yawned, and gave up.
Even now, he remembered the stunned silence in the stadium, the confused judges, the enraged competitors, and the boy’s carefree grin as he walked off the stage like it was just another playground game.
And now, that same boy stood there, shinai resting against his shoulder, looking far too relaxed for someone about to fight.
The proctor narrowed his eyes.
—
Shinchan’s parents sat in the audience, Hiroshi stretching his arms behind his head.
"Did you hear that, Misae? Our boy’s kind of famous here," he mused.
Misae rolled her eyes. "Don’t remind me. I still get embarrassed thinking about what he did back then."
Himawari, sitting beside them, had a smug expression. "Well, big brother better not embarrass us again~."
Hiroshi chuckled. "With all the training he’s been doing, I doubt he’ll pull the same stunt."
Misae sighed. "I hope you’re right."
Meanwhile, Shinchan’s sensei sat a few rows down, arms crossed, watching with sharp eyes.
Kazama, Ai, Masao, Nene, and Bo were in their own seats, gripping the railings, waiting in anticipation.
Ai exhaled. "This is so weird. I’ve never seen him fight seriously before."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "If what we’ve seen in practice is anything to go by… this won’t be normal."
Masao gulped. "You think he’ll be okay?"
Nene smirked. "I think the other guys should be worried."
Bo simply nodded.
—
The first match began.
Shinchan stood opposite his opponent, bowing before taking his stance.
The referee signaled, and—
CLACK!
The sound of wood striking armor echoed through the stadium.
"...Huh?"
The audience blinked.
It was over.
The opponent lay sprawled on the ground, his shinai knocked aside, his helmet slightly tilted from the sheer force of Shinchan’s strike.
The referee hesitated before raising his flag. "Men! Point awarded! Match over!"
Silence.
Then, an explosion of murmurs.
"What the hell was that?!"
"He just ended him in one move!"
"He didn’t even hesitate!"
Ai, Kazama, and the rest of the group gaped.
Misae and Hiroshi exchanged glances.
Himawari gasped. "Wha—? That’s my brother?"
Shinchan simply adjusted his gloves, walking off like nothing had happened.
—
The second match.
The third.
The fourth.
All of them ended in the same way.
One strike.
One moment of hesitation from his opponents.
And it was over.
By the time the quarter-finals rolled around, the entire stadium was in an uproar. The whispers of his past only grew louder, spreading beyond just the spectators.
"So it’s true… he was a prodigy."
"And he’s serious this time?"
"Shit. He’s a monster."
The proctor, watching from the side, smirked. So the lazy kid finally decided to play for real, huh?
—
As Shinchan stepped onto the mat for the semi-finals, he finally stretched his arms, rolling his shoulders.
"Hah… maybe I should start trying now."
His next opponent flinched.
The audience held their breath.
And the fight began.

Chapter 64 – The Semi-Finals
The tension in the air was heavier than before. Unlike Shinchan’s previous matches, where his opponents barely lasted a few seconds, this one felt different from the moment the match started. His opponent was strong.
The moment the referee called for the match to begin, Shinchan's opponent lunged forward, his shinai striking fast and hard.
CLACK!
Shinchan barely deflected it in time, stepping back as another strike came his way.
Oh?
He smirked under his helmet.
For the first time since the tournament began, he felt something close to excitement. His opponent wasn’t just some pushover—he was experienced, skilled, and most importantly, unafraid.
The crowd leaned forward, murmuring.
"He’s not winning in one strike this time."
"Yeah… but look at him. He’s still playing around."
Kazama pushed his glasses up, eyes narrowed. "No… he’s testing the waters."
Masao gulped. "Testing the waters?! He’s already in the semi-finals!"
Ai, arms crossed, watched closely. So, what will you do, Shinchan?
—
Shinchan stayed on the defensive for a while, blocking and sidestepping every attack with minimal movement. It was almost frustrating how effortlessly he evaded, his opponent attacking again and again, unable to land a clean hit.
His opponent gritted his teeth. "Are you going to attack or what?"
Shinchan tilted his head slightly, his stance still relaxed.
"Mm, maybe."
The sheer audacity of his response made his opponent momentarily hesitate—just for a second.
There it is.
Shinchan moved.
With a sudden burst of speed, he closed the distance between them. His opponent barely had time to react as Shinchan’s shinai came swinging down.
CLACK!
The impact rang out through the arena as his opponent blocked the strike just in time. The sheer force of it made his arms tremble, and for the first time, fear flickered in his eyes.
It was different from before.
Shinchan had been playing defense all this time. Holding back.
Now?
He was attacking.
And he wasn’t stopping.
One strike.
Two.
Three.
His opponent barely kept up. The audience watched in stunned silence as Shinchan, who had previously been toying with his opponents, now moved with calculated precision, pushing his opponent back with every attack.
Even his friends could barely believe their eyes.
"This is the first time I’ve seen him actually fight," Nene whispered.
Kazama clenched his fists. "He’s different now. It’s not just skill… He wants to win."
Ai’s gaze softened slightly. So, you’re finally moving forward.
—
The match lasted longer than anyone expected. Shinchan’s opponent was skilled, resilient, and refused to go down easily. But Shinchan wasn’t flustered. If anything, he seemed amused.
Finally, after a particularly fast exchange of blows, he saw an opening.
It lasted only a fraction of a second.
But for Shinchan, it was enough.
Now.
He lunged forward.
MEN!
His shinai struck his opponent’s helmet, clean and undeniable.
The referee raised his flag.
"Point awarded! Match over!"
A beat of silence.
Then—cheers erupted from the audience.
Shinchan stepped back, exhaling. His opponent collapsed to his knees, panting.
"...Shit."
Shinchan grinned, extending a hand.
"You’re strong. That was fun."
His opponent hesitated before grasping his hand.
"...Same to you."
As Shinchan walked off the stage, he casually stretched, rolling his shoulders.
"Haaahh, one more match left."
He glanced toward the stands, where his friends were practically losing their minds.
Ai smirked, shaking her head.
Kazama adjusted his glasses.
Masao and Nene were jumping in excitement.
Bo gave a small thumbs-up.
And his parents? Hiroshi was grinning like a proud dad. Misae wiped a tear dramatically. Himawari simply folded her arms, smug.
Shinchan sighed.
"...Guess I can't lose now, huh?"

Chapter 65 – The Final Opponent
Shinchan stepped onto the stage, his shinai resting lightly in his grip. The crowd murmured, excited for the final match. But as his opponent walked onto the platform, a strange silence fell over the audience—like a sudden realization had washed over them all at once.
Shinchan’s eyes flickered with recognition.
His opponent smirked, tightening his grip on the shinai.
"So we finally meet again, Nohara."
Shinchan blinked. Then, after a moment of realization, he let out a quiet laugh.
"Ahhh, so it’s you, huh?"
The referee prepared to start the match, but the entire stadium was already in chaos.
"Wait… that name…?"
"That’s… that’s Takasugi Renji!"
"The one from that match in kindergarten!"
The realization hit like a shockwave. The story had already spread earlier in the day, but now it was real. The same opponent from Shinchan’s fateful kindergarten match—the one where he had made it to the finals, only to give up on purpose—was standing in front of him again, after all these years.
This time, there would be no walking away.
For Takasugi Renji, this was the moment he had waited for.
Ever since that kindergarten match, his life had been filled with whispers, mocking laughter, and frustration. He had trained relentlessly, rising through the ranks, climbing to the top. But no matter how much he won, there was always one stain on his record—one moment in his past that haunted him.
Because in the most important match of his childhood… he didn’t win.
Shinchan had given up on his own.
And nothing could be more humiliating.
—
A sudden memory flickered through Shinchan’s mind.
The old dojo. The cracked wooden floor beneath his feet. The scent of aged wood and sweat.
His sensei stood before him, shinai in hand, his stance unwavering.
Shinchan exhaled, gripping his weapon. "I don’t want to do this, you know."
His sensei simply looked at him. Then, without a word, he attacked.
Shinchan barely had time to react. His sensei’s strike was fast, almost too fast. He blocked it instinctively, but the force sent a tremor through his arms.
"You’ve been running, Shin." His sensei’s voice was calm, but firm. "And I let you. I let you walk away from Kendo because I knew forcing you back wouldn’t do anything."
CLACK! Another strike. Shinchan barely sidestepped, but his sensei closed the distance again.
"But now… you’re here."
A flurry of attacks followed. Shinchan gritted his teeth, forced to defend over and over again.
"You never lost your talent. You never lost your skill. The only thing you lost…"
Shinchan blocked a heavy downward strike. His feet skidded slightly across the old wooden floor.
"…was your resolve."
The next strike was too fast.
His sensei’s shinai struck his shoulder. The pain jolted through him, but before he could even process it, the next blow came—a clean, precise hit to his helmet.
Point.
Shinchan stumbled back, breathing hard.
"Are you going to run again?" His sensei’s voice cut through the silence.
Shinchan wiped sweat from his forehead, exhaling.
And then—he smirked.
"…No."
He raised his shinai.
This time, when he attacked, it was with full intent.
—
Ting!
The referee’s flag waved.
"Match—begin!"
Renji shot forward, attacking instantly.
CLACK! Shinchan blocked, his feet shifting slightly.
The force behind Renji’s strike was powerful—different from his previous opponents. There was rage behind it, the kind of anger that had been simmering for years.
"You really piss me off, you know that?" Renji muttered as he struck again.
Shinchan tilted his head, blocking effortlessly. "Why’s that?"
Renji gritted his teeth.
"You gave up. You made me win by default. You stole my victory from me!"
His attacks became more aggressive, faster, each strike filled with years of frustration. Shinchan absorbed the blows, sidestepping, never attacking back.
"You never even took it seriously! And yet—everyone still talks about you!"
CLACK! CLACK!
"You just walked away like it meant nothing! Like Kendo meant nothing to you!"
Shinchan exhaled through his nose.
The way Renji spoke… It was so familiar.
A memory of Kazama flashed through his mind, back when he first told him about his past in Kendo.
Kazama’s voice, laced with frustration—
"You could’ve been the best, Shinchan. You still can. Why would you waste that?"
Shinchan’s grip tightened slightly.
For the first time in the match, he attacked.
Renji’s eyes widened as Shinchan’s shinai came down in a blur. He barely dodged, the air slicing past his helmet.
Shinchan adjusted his stance, rolling his shoulders.
"Alright, fine," he muttered.
Renji narrowed his eyes. "What?"
Shinchan exhaled.
"You’re right," he admitted. "I didn’t take that match seriously."
Renji’s breath hitched.
"But…"
Shinchan raised his shinai.
"Let me make it up to you."
Then, he moved.
The attack came so fast that Renji’s brain barely processed it before instinct took over. He blocked, but the sheer impact rattled through his arms.
Shinchan didn’t stop.
One attack. Then another. And another.
The stadium was silent.
No one had ever seen Shinchan fight like this before.
This wasn’t just skill. This wasn’t just talent.
This was intention.
The battle raged on, an explosive clash of strikes and counters. But with each exchange, Renji was forced back, his movements growing more desperate.
Shinchan was overwhelming him.
—
Up in the stands, his friends watched in stunned silence.
Ai’s fingers curled slightly. This is the real Shinchan.
Kazama pushed his glasses up. "He’s not holding back anymore."
Even Masao and Nene, who usually joked around, were speechless.
"…He looks cool," Masao whispered.
Nene nodded. "Like, really cool."
Himawari, arms crossed, simply grinned. "Of course, he does. He’s my big brother, after all."
Their parents and sensei watched proudly.
—
Back on the stage, Renji panted heavily, sweat dripping down his face.
He had trained for this moment. He had waited years for it.
And yet—he still wasn’t enough.
Shinchan tilted his head slightly. "You good?"
Renji clenched his jaw.
"DON’T—"
Shinchan moved.
MEN!
His shinai struck clean.
The referee’s flag shot up.
"POINT! MATCH OVER!"
The stadium erupted in cheers.
Shinchan exhaled, lowering his weapon. He turned to Renji, extending a hand.
Renji stared at it for a long moment.
Then, he took it.
Shinchan grinned.
"You got your answer now?"
Renji exhaled, shaking his head.
"…Yeah. Damn it."
As the crowd cheered, as his friends ran toward him, as his sensei gave him a rare approving nod—
Shinchan stretched, cracking his neck.
"Man… that was tiring."
Then, with a wide, triumphant grin—
"Let’s go eat."

Chapter 66 – The Champion’s Celebration
The award ceremony was the usual formal affair—bows, speeches, and polite claps. Shinchan stood on the podium, gold medal around his neck, his expression somewhere between smug and utterly bored as the announcer droned on about his “exceptional display of skill and determination.”
The only thing keeping him awake was the thought of food.
Still, when it came time, he performed the proper bows, shook the necessary hands, and even managed to keep a straight face when the exam proctor practically whispered, “So you were that kindergarten brat.”
After the ceremony ended, he made his way through the bustling venue. His body ached, his stomach rumbled, and all he wanted was to take a long bath.
But first, there was one more thing to do.
Shinchan stepped outside the building where a familiar, slightly run-down van was parked near the entrance. Standing beside it was his old sensei, arms crossed, waiting.
For the first time since childhood, Shinchan bowed deeply, his forehead almost touching his knees.
“…Thanks, old man.”
His sensei snorted. “Took you long enough to say that.”
Shinchan straightened, cracking a grin. “Come on, you knew I was always grateful deep down.”
“You’re mistaking laziness for gratitude.”
“Same thing, really.”
His sensei shook his head, but the smallest of smiles played at his lips.
“…You did well.”
Shinchan blinked. He had expected a punch to the gut, a lecture, maybe even a demand to clean the dojo floor for the next month. But just those three words?
Somehow, they carried more weight than an entire speech.
His sensei turned and climbed into the van. “You better keep practicing. If you slack off again, I’ll personally drag you back.”
Shinchan laughed. “Yeah, yeah. You can try.”
The old man snorted before driving off.
And with that, Shinchan finally turned toward the place where his real suffering awaited—his family and friends.
—
He barely made it two steps before he was ambushed.
"BIG BROOOO!!"
A missile in the form of Himawari latched onto his waist. "You were so cool!! I almost forgot you were my dumb big brother!"
"Almost?" Shinchan patted her head. "That hurts, ya know."
Misae sighed. "You did well, Shin. I’m proud of you."
Even Hiroshi, who usually never got emotional, clapped a hand on his shoulder. "You made us all proud, son. And you looked manly doing it!"
Shinchan wiped away a fake tear. "Man, it’s rare to get praise from you guys. I should win tournaments more often."
Misae immediately scowled. "Don’t let it get to your head."
But before Shinchan could make another joke, an even bigger disaster struck.
His friends.
Masao, Nene, and Bo-chan rushed toward him like a stampede.
Kazama, adjusting his glasses, looked as if he had way too many things to say.
And Ai—well, she was standing to the side, watching with an unreadable expression.
"You were incredible!" Masao shouted. "We were in awe!"
"I almost cried!" Nene admitted. "Almost!"
"Mm," Bo-chan nodded sagely. "Unexpectedly cool."
Kazama crossed his arms. "You have a lot of explaining to do."
Shinchan scratched his cheek. "Ehh? What’s there to explain?"
Kazama twitched. "YOU THREW AWAY THE FINALS AS A KID, AND THEN SUDDENLY DECIDE TO DESTROY EVERYONE IN HIGH SCHOOL?!"
"Details, details."
"THAT’S NOT JUST DETAILS!"
Masao shook his head dramatically. "Kazama, we must face the truth. Our Shinchan was secretly a genius all along."
Nene crossed her arms. "No, he’s just insane."
Bo-chan nodded. "Both."
Shinchan grinned. "Aww, you guys flatter me."
Kazama groaned. "That wasn’t a compliment."
Before the bickering could continue, Ai clapped her hands once.
"Enough of that," she said. "It’s time for the celebration!"
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "Huh? What celebration?"
Ai beamed. "Your victory celebration, of course!"
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. "…Define ‘celebration’."
Ai’s smile widened. "You’ll see."
—
To Shinchan’s absolute shock, the "celebration" wasn’t in a high-end, fancy restaurant or some extravagant venue.
No.
It was in a simple, humble little ramen shop tucked away in a quiet street.
Ai had picked a normal place.
Shinchan gawked at her. "Are you sick?"
Ai gave him an unimpressed look. "Excuse me?"
"You, Miss Fancy-Pants, choosing a normal ramen shop over some luxurious high-end restaurant? I need proof this is the real you."
Ai huffed, crossing her arms. "Well, I thought about it! But then I figured… a celebration should be about you. Not me."
Shinchan blinked.
Ai looked away, cheeks slightly puffed. "Besides, I know you. If I dragged you somewhere too fancy, you’d be miserable the whole time."
Masao wiped a fake tear. "True love is real."
Nene gasped. "She actually understands him."
Bo-chan nodded. "Miraculous."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "This is character development."
Ai turned red. "Sh-Shut up!"
Shinchan just grinned. "Aww, Ai-chan, you do know me so well."
She smacked his arm.
As the group settled in, food was ordered, and the night was filled with laughter.
Shinchan, despite all the teasing and embarrassment, felt something… different.
He was back to his usual self—lazy, ridiculous, and carefree. But there was something new inside him now. A fire that hadn’t been there before.
He had fought.
He had won.
And for the first time in a long time…
He was looking forward to whatever came next.

Chapter 67 – The Prodigious President
The day after the tournament was chaos.
The moment Shinchan stepped foot inside the school gates, he felt it—the uncomfortable weight of everyone’s attention.
Students whispered in hushed tones. Some blatantly pointed at him. Even the teachers stole glances his way as if they had just realized he existed.
"That’s him."
"The student council president—he won the entire competition!"
"I heard he destroyed the semi-finals in a single strike."
"Didn’t he throw the finals in kindergarten just because he felt like it?!"
"Legend says he’s been secretly training for years in the mountains—"
"Wait, isn’t he the same guy who once mooned the principal?!"
Shinchan sighed, hands in his pockets as he strolled toward the building. "Man… it’s like these people just realized I go here."
Kazama, walking beside him, adjusted his glasses. "I mean, can you blame them? You are the first student council president in history to also be a Kendo champion."
Masao, on Shinchan’s other side, nodded furiously. "Yeah! You’re like… too powerful now."
Bo-chan, ever the philosopher, stated, "Shin is like a character from an overpowered anime."
Shinchan grinned. "Oho? Are you saying I’m the protagonist?"
Nene, who had just caught up, scoffed. "Yeah, the protagonist of a comedy anime."
Before Shinchan could retort, a loud voice rang through the hall.
"GOOD MORNING, PRESIDENT-SAMA!"
Shinchan turned to see an entire crowd of first-years bowing dramatically in unison.
"Your strength was inspiring! We look forward to your wise leadership!"
Shinchan blinked. Then grinned.
"Finally, some proper respect!"
Kazama facepalmed. "You don’t deserve this."
Nene rolled her eyes. "He’s so going to let this get to his head."
Masao clapped his hands together. "President-sama, please grant me strength!"
Bo-chan tilted his head. "What would Shin’s special move be?"
Shinchan dramatically raised a hand. "‘Thousand-Year Cheek Stretch’!"
He immediately grabbed Kazama’s face and pulled.
"GAH! LET GO, YOU IDIOT!"
Kazama shoved him off, rubbing his face as the first-years watched in horror.
One of them whispered, "He’s so powerful, he even bullies the vice president!"
Another murmured, "His strength has no limits..."
Shinchan threw an arm over Kazama’s shoulder. "Don’t be jealous, my loyal vice president. If you train hard enough, maybe you too can master the ancient arts of Cheek Stretching."
Kazama sighed. "I hate you."
—
The real struggle, however, came when they entered the classroom.
The moment Shinchan walked in, the entire class erupted.
"Shin-chan!!"
"Our class’s pride!"
"Teach us your ways, Sensei!"
Even the teacher stopped mid-lecture to say, "Congratulations, Nohara. That was quite a performance."
Shinchan lazily waved. "Thank you, thank you. Autographs are twenty yen each."
Ai, sitting at her desk, sighed. "And there he goes."
The entire day was like that—people stopping him in the hallways, teachers asking about his training, even some seniors bowing when they passed him.
For someone who spent years as a goofy troublemaker, this was new.
Did he hate it?
…Not at all.
Did he love it?
A little.
By lunchtime, Shinchan was already planning how to maximize this situation for free food.
But just as he was about to suggest an idea to the group, a certain someone burst into the classroom.
Hayashi.
His old election rival stood at the doorway, eyes narrowed. "You."
Shinchan blinked. "Me."
Hayashi stomped forward, slamming both hands on Shinchan’s desk. "How could you hide your talent for so long?!"
Shinchan smirked. "If I told you, it wouldn’t be hidden, now would it?"
Hayashi twitched. "Unacceptable. You must face me in a battle of skill!"
Shinchan yawned. "Nah."
"WHAT?!"
"I don’t fight pointless battles."
Hayashi glared. "Then what do you fight for?"
Shinchan leaned back in his chair, grinning. "Lunch."
Masao gasped. "So noble."
Nene sighed. "He’s so stupid."
Bo-chan nodded. "Understandable."
Kazama groaned. "Can you not make everything a joke?!"
Ai just smiled.
Hayashi, defeated, stormed out of the classroom, mumbling about “incomprehensible idiots.”
As the class continued chatting, Shinchan leaned back, stretching his arms.
The attention would fade soon, the whispers would die down, and life would go back to normal.
But for now…
He was having fun.

Chapter 69 – The Love Letter
The day had finally started to calm down. The whispers about Shinchan’s victory had faded into the background, and the group was getting ready to head home.
They walked together toward the lockers, chatting about completely unrelated things.
"I'm telling you," Shinchan said, lazily stretching his arms behind his head, "if I really wanted to, I could probably start charging for autographs."
Kazama rolled his eyes. "You do not have that level of fame."
Masao gasped. "But what if he does?!"
"Masao, don’t encourage him," Nene scolded.
Bo-chan, ever the quiet observer, tilted his head. "Would people pay?"
Shinchan grinned. "Only one way to find out—"
"—Wait." Ai had stopped in front of her locker.
The others turned to see her standing completely still, staring inside.
"What’s wrong?" Nene asked.
Ai slowly reached in and pulled out a neatly folded envelope—pure white, with her name elegantly written on the front.
A love letter.
The hallway around them suddenly felt silent.
Nene’s eyes widened. Masao’s jaw dropped. Kazama adjusted his glasses with a knowing look. Bo-chan blinked slowly.
And Shinchan?
He was squinting at the letter like it was a tax document.
"Oh-ho~" Nene smirked. "Ai-chan~ What do we have here~?"
Ai stared at the letter for a moment longer before her lips curved into a sly smile. "It seems I have a secret admirer."
Masao grabbed Bo-chan’s shoulders and shook him. "Bo-chan! Love is happening in real time!"
Bo-chan nodded. "It is."
Kazama crossed his arms. "Well, this isn’t surprising. Ai-chan is one of the most popular girls in school."
Ai gave a graceful giggle, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "Oh, Kazama-kun, you flatter me."
Nene leaned forward. "Well? Are you gonna open it?"
Ai tapped her chin. "Hmm… Should I?"
Masao and Nene nodded aggressively. Kazama looked mildly curious. Bo-chan just watched.
Meanwhile, Shinchan…
He yawned. "Eh."
Ai raised an eyebrow. "Eh?"
Shinchan scratched his head. "I mean, if you wanna read it, go ahead. If not, toss it. No big deal."
Kazama gave him a look. "That is not how normal people react to love letters."
Shinchan shrugged. "If it's a real confession, they should just say it to her face."
Ai tapped the letter against her palm, glancing at Shinchan with a small, unreadable smile. "How logical of you, President-sama."
Nene smirked. "Ohh, what’s this? Shin-chan isn’t reacting? Should we be disappointed?"
Masao gasped. "Should we be concerned?"
Bo-chan nodded. "Should we?"
Shinchan groaned. "Why do you guys care more than she does?"
Ai giggled. "It is flattering." She twirled the envelope between her fingers. "And I am a little curious."
Masao leaned forward. "So are you gonna—"
Ai, without hesitation, tore the envelope open.
The group held their breath as she unfolded the letter, her eyes scanning the contents.
Then, suddenly—
Ai let out a laugh. A genuine, amused laugh.
Nene blinked. "What? What’s funny?"
Ai turned the letter around.
Inside, written in perfectly neat handwriting, was a simple message:
"Your beauty shines like the sun. Please notice me. Also, I love your hair. - Anonymous"
Silence.
Then—
Shinchan cackled. "PFFT—That’s it?!"
Kazama rubbed his temples. "That’s… honestly kind of underwhelming."
Masao nodded. "I expected something deep."
Bo-chan blinked. "At least they like her hair."
Ai folded the letter neatly and placed it back in her locker. "Cute."
Nene crossed her arms. "You’re just gonna leave it?"
Ai smiled. "Well, if they decide to confess in person, then maybe I’ll entertain them." She glanced at Shinchan. "Since someone seems completely unaffected."
Shinchan snorted. "You get those a lot, don’t you?"
Ai winked. "Wouldn’t you like to know?"
Shinchan smirked. "Nah, I already do. That’s why I’m so calm about it."
Kazama sighed. "I have no idea what that even means."
Masao clasped his hands together. "May the anonymous letter-writer find peace."
Bo-chan nodded. "A noble wish."
As the group left the school, Ai walked beside Shinchan, casually twirling the torn envelope between her fingers.
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "You keeping that?"
Ai hummed. "It was my first love letter since coming back."
Shinchan smirked. "Want me to write you a better one?"
Ai grinned. "If you dare, President-sama."
Shinchan chuckled. "Challenge accepted."

Chapter 71 – The Letters Keep Coming
The next morning, Ai opened her locker and found two more letters neatly placed inside.
She blinked. Then, a slow smirk spread across her lips.
Oh?
This was getting interesting.
She held up the letters as the group gathered around.
"Another one?" Nene raised an eyebrow.
Masao gasped. "It’s multiplying!"
Bo-chan nodded. "They are evolving."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Not surprising. With Ai-chan's popularity, it's a miracle this didn’t start earlier."
Ai tapped her chin playfully. "Hmm~ I wonder who could be so smitten with me?"
Shinchan, leaning against the lockers, yawned. "Probably just another guy who likes your hair."
Ai shot him a glance. "Jealous, President-sama?"
Shinchan stretched his arms lazily. "Pfft, of what?"
Ai smiled sweetly and pressed one of the letters to her chest. "Of the mystery person who is sooooo~ in love with me~."
Shinchan blinked. Then snorted. "Yeah, yeah. Tell your admirer I said hi."
Kazama sighed. "You are incredibly dense."
Masao looked between Ai and Shinchan. "Is… is this flirting? Are we watching something happen in real time?"
Bo-chan nodded. "Observing closely."
Ai ignored the others and opened one of the letters, reading it out loud in an exaggeratedly dreamy voice.
"Ai-chan, your smile is like a beacon of light in my heart… Every time I see you, my world becomes brighter…"
She let out a swoon and dramatically pressed her hand to her forehead. "Oh my~ How romantic~!"
Shinchan squinted. "Sounds like they copy-pasted that from a bad drama."
Ai gasped, placing a hand over her heart. "Shin-chan, how dare you insult my precious admirer!"
Shinchan smirked. "Should I be worried?"
Ai fluttered her lashes. "Oh, I don’t know~ Maybe I’m falling for them~"
Shinchan gave her a look. "Yeah, sure."
Ai stepped closer, her voice turning silky smooth. "Mmm… What if I told you that I adore this person? That my heart races every time I read their words?"
Shinchan stared at her. Then he grinned.
"Damn," he said. "That bad, huh?"
Ai gawked at him.
Nene wheeze-laughed. "Oh my god, Shin-chan, that was not the reaction she wanted!"
Masao whispered, "He’s immune…"
Bo-chan nodded. "An unshakable force."
Ai huffed, crossing her arms. "Well, you certainly aren’t romantic."
Shinchan grinned. "Hey, I offered to write you a better love letter yesterday. You didn’t take me up on it."
Ai’s eyes twinkled. "Oh? So if I demand one now, will you deliver?"
Shinchan shrugged. "Depends. You want something deep and poetic or just 'nice hair'?"
Kazama rubbed his temples. "You are infuriating."
Ai sighed dramatically. "Oh, whatever shall I do? My poor heart is torn between my mystery suitor and my emotionally stunted childhood friend."
Shinchan cackled. "Pfft—'emotionally stunted'? Rude."
Ai smirked. "Oh? So you do have emotions?"
Shinchan leaned in slightly. "Maaaybe."
The group stared.
Masao whispered, "Oh my god, he’s actually flirting back."
Bo-chan nodded. "Historic moment."
Nene beamed. "Keep going. This is so entertaining."
Ai hummed, taking a step back. "Well then, I suppose I should write my admirer a response~"
Shinchan waved lazily. "Have fun."
Ai grinned. "I will~ I’ll tell them how cute and cool I think they are~ How they make my heart skip a beat~"
Shinchan blinked once. Twice.
His grin didn’t falter, but he casually glanced away and rubbed the back of his neck.
Ai's smirk widened.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Oh. My. God."
Masao grabbed Bo-chan. "DID YOU SEE THAT?!"
Bo-chan nodded. "He flinched."
Nene cackled. "She got to him."
Ai, ever so smug, held her letters close to her chest and turned toward her locker. "Well then, I should head to class~ Don’t want to keep my admirer waiting~"
Shinchan scoffed. "Yeah, yeah. Have fun with your soap opera romance."
Ai giggled. "Oh, I will~"
As she walked away, Shinchan stared after her for a second before shaking his head with a grin.
Kazama nudged him. "She totally got to you."
Shinchan yawned. "Tch. Maybe."
Masao gasped. "He admitted it!"
Bo-chan nodded. "Another historic moment."
Nene smirked. "This is only the beginning."
Shinchan sighed dramatically. "Man… maybe I should start charging for autographs."

The torture continued.
In class, Ai swooned dramatically as she read through yet another letter, sighing with fake adoration.
"Oh my~ my mysterious admirer says I have the most enchanting eyes~"
Shinchan scribbled in his notebook without looking up. "Must be legally blind."
Ai gasped. "Shin-chan! You wound me!"
Kazama smirked from the desk beside them. "No, no, please continue. This is very entertaining."
Nene nodded. "Oh yes. This is my favorite show now."
During PE, Ai twirled around the field, letter in hand, humming to herself. "I wonder what kind of person they are~ Maybe they’re handsome~ Maybe they’re so strong and cool~"
Shinchan jogged past her. "Hope they like girls who trip over their own ego."
Ai gasped theatrically. "Are you jealous, Shin-chan?"
Shinchan scoffed. "Jealous of what? Some guy who writes like a budget romance novel author?"
Masao wheezed. "I can’t—you guys are ridiculous."
At lunch, Ai took a bite of her food and sighed. "Oh my… If my admirer was here, they’d totally feed me, wouldn’t they?"
Shinchan crushed his juice box in his hand.
Kazama raised a brow. "Oh wow, he’s actually getting mad."
Bo-chan nodded. "Fascinating."
Then came the final straw—Student Council work.
They were alone. Just the two of them.
Ai stretched in her chair, her letters neatly stacked on the table. "Ahh~ another one today~ It’s so nice to be appreciated~"
Shinchan’s pen stopped mid-signature.
She smiled sweetly at him. "Wouldn’t you agree, President-sama~?"
A loud thud.
Before Ai could blink, she was backed against the wall, Shinchan’s hand pressed against the surface beside her head.
A full-on kabe-don.
Ai’s brain shut down.
Shinchan leaned in slightly, eyes half-lidded, voice low. "So tell me, Ai-chan…"
She swallowed. Holy hell—
"Is this enough?"
She blinked rapidly, heart pounding. "W-What?"
He tilted his head. "Is this enough for you to stop talking about that dweeb in the letters?"
Ai could not process words.
Her entire face burned.
Her brain was melting.
Shinchan smirked. "Cat got your tongue?"
Ai squeaked.
She SQUEAKED.
Shinchan pulled back with a victorious grin. "Thought so."
Ai was left standing there, red-faced and flustered beyond belief.
By the time they reached the Student Council office, Ai still wasn’t functioning properly.
She walked in wrong. Like a glitching robot.
Nene squinted. "Uh… Ai-chan? You good?"
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "…What happened?"
Masao gasped. "Did she lose?!"
Bo-chan nodded. "Unprecedented event."
Shinchan casually sat down. "Nothing much. Just found a way to shut her up."
Ai, still flustered, turned redder.
Nene’s jaw dropped. "NO. WAY."
Masao whispered, "He actually won."
Kazama smirked. "Ai-chan, are you blushing?"
Ai immediately turned away, face still burning.
Shinchan leaned back, completely satisfied.
For the first time in forever, Ai-chan had no comeback.
And Shinchan?
Shinchan was living for it.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 73 – Flipping the Game
Shinchan sat in his seat, arms crossed, watching Ai from the corner of his eye.
She was still fidgety.
It had been a full day since the legendary kabe-don incident, and Ai-chan—normally composed, flirtatious, and annoyingly confident—was now reduced to a blushing mess.
Every time their eyes met, she turned away.
Every time he walked past her, she got stiff.
It was hilarious.
And that’s when an idea sparked in his devious brain.
She had always been the one making moves. Always teasing him, always trying to fluster him, always testing his limits.
But what if… he flipped the game?
What if… for the first time ever… he made her the victim?
A slow, mischievous grin spread across his face.
Oh, this was going to be fun.
—
The next morning, Shinchan executed his plan.
It started simple.
Ai walked into the classroom, expecting things to return to normal.
Instead, she was immediately greeted with:
"Good morning, Ai-chan~"
Her soul left her body.
Shinchan had never said her name like that before. The smooth, deep tone. The slight purr at the end.
Ai froze.
Shinchan walked past her, casually—like he hadn’t just dropped a bomb on her first thing in the morning.
She turned to Nene in shock. "Did you hear that?"
Nene, sipping her juice box, smirked. "Oh, I heard it."
Ai turned back, staring at Shinchan with suspicion.
But that was just the beginning.
—
In PE, Ai was drinking water when Shinchan walked by, leaned in slightly, and murmured:
"You look cute today, Ai-chan."
Ai choked.
Literally choked on her water.
Masao gasped. "OH MY GOD, SHINCHAN'S FLIRTING?!"
Kazama dropped his notebook. "Impossible—"
Bo-chan nodded. "Reversal of roles."
Meanwhile, Ai stared at Shinchan, bewildered, as he casually walked off like nothing happened.
—
At lunch, he went even further.
Ai was about to sit down, but before she could, Shinchan smoothly pulled out the chair for her.
"Here you go, Ai-chan~"
She stared.
Nene, Kazama, Masao, and Bo all stared.
Masao whispered. "Who is this man?"
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Shinchan has evolved."
Nene leaned forward. "Ai-chan, how do you feel?"
Ai gripped the table. "Like I’m experiencing a fever dream."
Meanwhile, Shinchan just grinned.
—
Then came the final blow.
Student Council work.
The same place where he had ruined her the day before.
Ai cautiously sat at her desk, expecting something, anything.
Shinchan, still looking through paperwork, casually placed a hand on top of hers.
Ai stiffened.
He leaned in, voice low. "Ai-chan, you’re trembling~"
Ai short-circuited.
Her entire body froze.
Her brain shut down.
Shinchan smirked. "Something wrong?"
She squeaked.
Shinchan grinned. "Oh? Is the great Ai-chan actually getting flustered?"
Ai yanked her hand away and stood up so fast, her chair fell over.
"I— I need— WATER—" She bolted out of the room.
Shinchan leaned back, fully satisfied.
For the first time in history, Ai-chan had been defeated.
And he was going to enjoy this for as long as possible.

Chapter 74 – Sharing an Umbrella
The game continued.
All morning, Ai was subjected to unrelenting attacks.
Every little move—every whispered compliment, every brush of his hand, every knowing smirk—left her utterly flustered.
She tried to fight back, to regain her usual edge, but Shinchan was ten steps ahead.
And by lunchtime, she was a mess.
But the real fun was yet to come.
—
It started in the afternoon.
The moment the final bell rang, the downpour began.
Heavy sheets of rain hammered against the windows.
Nene sighed. "Crap, it’s raining."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Looks like we’ll have to share umbrellas."
The group gathered at the entrance, pulling out their umbrellas.
Bo-chan had one.
Masao had one.
Kazama and Nene paired up.
That left—
Ai and Shinchan.
Ai froze.
Her eyes darted between Shinchan and the single umbrella in his hand.
Shinchan raised an eyebrow, grinning. "What’s wrong, Ai-chan? You don’t wanna share?"
Ai stiffened. "I— I—"
Nene smirked. "Well, we should get going~ You two have fun."
Ai turned. "WAIT—"
Too late.
The others disappeared into the rain.
Leaving Ai alone with him.
Shinchan smirked. "Guess it’s just us, huh?"
Ai exhaled sharply, then steeled herself.
It’s just an umbrella. She could handle this.
She marched forward. "Fine. Let’s go."
—
The rain poured as they stepped out onto the street.
The umbrella wasn’t small, but with the wind blowing rain sideways, they had to huddle close.
Ai tried to maintain distance.
But every time she did, she got drenched.
And Shinchan noticed.
With a wicked grin, he pulled her closer.
"You’ll get wet if you don’t stay under properly, Ai-chan~"
Ai tensed.
She could feel the warmth of his body against her shoulder. The light scent of his shampoo. The way his arm brushed against hers as they walked.
It was too much.
She swallowed. "I— I can hold it."
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Then here you go."
He handed her the umbrella.
Ai blinked.
Shinchan stepped out from under it, walking beside her in the rain, completely unbothered.
Ai panicked. "Wait— What are you doing?!"
Shinchan shrugged. "You said you could handle it."
Ai groaned. "Ugh! You’re so annoying!"
She grabbed his arm and yanked him back under.
Shinchan grinned. "Oh~? You want me close?"
Ai blushed furiously. "Shut up and walk."
Shinchan chuckled.
This was too easy.
The rain kept pouring. Their pace slowed. And for a moment… it was just the two of them, under the umbrella, in a little world of their own.
Ai sighed, watching the raindrops. "This is kinda nice, though."
Shinchan glanced at her. "What, sharing an umbrella?"
Ai smirked. "No. The fact that you’re suffering."
Shinchan snorted. "Oh? You wanna suffer too?"
Before Ai could react, he tilted the umbrella—just enough to let a stream of water splash onto her.
Ai yelped. "SHINNOSUKE!!"
Shinchan laughed and took off running.
Ai chased him, soaked, furious, and completely red in the face.
And in the middle of the rain, Shinchan knew—he had won today too.

Chapter 75 – Masao and Nene
The festival had changed something.
It wasn’t obvious at first.
To an outsider, Nene and Masao were the same as ever—bickering, teasing, and throwing insults like always.
But underneath it… there was a shift.
And neither of them wanted to admit it.
—
Masao wasn’t sure when it started.
Maybe it was the festival. Maybe it was before that. But lately, every time Nene called him an idiot… it didn’t sting like before.
Maybe because she didn't say it with malice anymore.
And maybe because, once in a while, her tone was… softer.
—
One afternoon, the group was hanging out at a café.
Shinchan and Ai were bickering as usual.
Kazama was arguing with Hima over something about student rankings.
And Masao… was stuck in a conversation with Nene.
She sipped her drink. "So, you’re still drawing those weird horror manga?"
Masao frowned. "They’re not weird."
Nene smirked. "Then what are they?"
Masao straightened up. "They’re masterpieces!"
Nene rolled her eyes but smiled. "Fine, fine, genius artist. You ever show anyone?"
Masao paused.
He… never showed anyone.
Except—
He swallowed. "I… might show you sometime."
Nene blinked.
Masao froze.
Why the hell did he say that?!
Nene raised an eyebrow. "Huh. Alright, I’ll be waiting, Picasso."
Masao exhaled. That… wasn’t as embarrassing as he thought.
But then—
"Oi, Masao!"
Masao flinched as Shinchan suddenly threw an arm over his shoulder.
Shinchan grinned. "You’re getting mighty close with Nene, huh?"
Masao turned bright red. "IT’S NOT LIKE THAT!!"
Nene, on the other hand, smirked.
She leaned in with a mocking pout. "Oh~? Masao-kun, are you shy?"
Masao sputtered. "I’M NOT!!"
Shinchan cackled.
Ai watched with amusement. "Oh my, oh my~ This is getting interesting."
Kazama sighed. "Can you all act normal for five minutes?"
—
Later that evening, Masao walked home with Nene.
It was awkwardly quiet for a while.
Then—
"Hey."
Masao turned. "Yeah?"
Nene… hesitated.
Then, softly—
"Maybe I really do wanna see your manga."
Masao froze.
And for the first time in his life, he thought—
Maybe Nene-chan wasn’t so bad after all.

they arrived at his house. it wasnt weird for anyone, wasnt supposed to be as they came at each other places since childhood, but it was different.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 76 – A Different Kind of Visit
Masao knew this wasn’t weird.
He knew.
Nene had been to his house hundreds of times. Just like he had been to hers.
But today… it felt different.
—
They stood at his doorstep.
Masao fumbled for his keys.
Nene stood behind him, arms crossed, rocking on her heels like she wasn’t affected by the weird tension in the air.
Masao could have pretended nothing was off.
But then he glanced at Nene.
And she wasn’t looking at him like she usually did.
She was looking at his house like she was realizing something.
Masao cleared his throat. "You coming in or what?"
Nene blinked. "Y-Yeah. Of course."
—
Inside, Masao’s house was the same as ever.
Simple. Neat.
His mom greeted them without batting an eye.
"Oh, Nene-chan! Masao, be a good host, okay?"
Masao groaned. "Yeah, yeah…"
Nene smirked. "I always have to remind him of that too, Masao’s mom."
His mom laughed and left them alone.
Masao sighed and led Nene to his room.
—
Nene paused at the doorway.
Masao’s room was exactly what she expected—stacks of manga, sketchbooks everywhere, a tiny desk that looked like it had seen things.
But it was neater than she imagined.
Masao flopped onto his chair. "Alright, so you wanted to see my drawings, right?"
Nene hesitated.
She had said that.
But… was she really ready to see Masao’s inner world?
Masao must have sensed her hesitation because he smirked. "What, getting cold feet now?"
Nene huffed. "Of course not. Show me, Picasso."
Masao pulled out a sketchbook. "Okay, but no laughing."
—
She didn’t laugh.
She didn’t expect to be impressed.
But she was.
His lines were clean. His characters had expressions that felt real. The way he used shadows and angles…
It was good.
Nene found herself flipping through the pages, forgetting she was supposed to be teasing him.
Masao fidgeted. "Well?"
Nene looked up.
Masao was actually nervous.
She grinned. "This is… really good, Masao."
Masao froze.
Nene saw his ears turn red.
Then he looked away and mumbled, "Yeah, whatever…"
—
A comfortable silence settled between them.
For the first time in a long time… Nene wasn’t seeing Masao the crybaby or Masao the idiot.
She was seeing Masao.
And maybe… she liked what she saw.

next day shin was out shopping for his mom and ran in to ai. he teased her if she had to be thought how to shop like when they were 5, they walked and shopped only for shin to notice something. he saw kazama and hima hanging out. the 2 decided to follow.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 77 – A Suspicious Outing
Shinchan wasn’t expecting to run into Ai while running errands for Misae.
But there she was—standing in the middle of the grocery store aisle, staring at a bottle of soy sauce like it had personally offended her.
He couldn’t let this opportunity pass.
Sliding up beside her, he leaned in and whispered, "Do you need me to teach you how to shop again, like when we were five?"
Ai jumped.
Then she turned, already fuming. "Excuse me?!"
Shinchan grinned, casually tossing a pack of tofu into his basket. "Just making sure you weren’t about to call for help like last time."*
Ai huffed. "That was different! I was a child!"
"You were five."*
"And you were six!"*
"And yet," Shinchan said, leaning against the shelf, "I somehow knew how to shop."*
Ai crossed her arms. "Hmph. I don’t need help shopping. I’m a fully capable—" She stopped, then turned back to the soy sauce, picking up two different brands and frowning. "…Which one is better?"
Shinchan laughed. "Yeah, sure, totally capable."*
Ai smacked his arm, but she was laughing too.
—
They finished shopping together, Ai tossing a few extra things into his basket just to annoy him.
But then—
Shinchan froze.
His eyes locked onto something—or rather, someone—across the street.
Kazama.
And next to him—
Himawari.
Shinchan blinked. Then he blinked again.
Ai followed his gaze and gasped. "Oh? What’s this?"
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. "What’s Kazama doing with Hima?"
Ai smirked. "What do you think they’re doing?"
Shinchan didn’t answer. Instead, he grabbed Ai’s wrist and dragged her behind a vending machine.
"We’re following them."*
Ai grinned. "Oh, this is gonna be fun."*
—
They trailed after the two, keeping their distance.
Kazama and Himawari were definitely up to something.
They walked side by side, stopping in front of a cute café. Kazama opened the door for her.
Ai elbowed Shinchan. "Chivalry. How romantic."*
Shinchan scowled. "Tch. Don’t encourage him."*
Ai giggled. "Oh no, what if they start holding hands? What if—"
Shinchan clamped a hand over her mouth. "Shh! They’re going inside."*
Ai licked his palm.
Shinchan jerked his hand away in disgust. "EW, WHAT THE HELL—"
"Shhh!" Ai whispered. "They’ll hear us!"*
Shinchan wiped his hand on his shirt, glaring at her. "You’re disgusting."*
"And you’re an overprotective big brother."*
Shinchan groaned. "Let’s just go see what’s going on."*
—
They peered through the café window.
Inside, Kazama and Himawari sat across from each other.
Talking.
Laughing.
Kazama looked… relaxed.
And Himawari looked… happy.
Shinchan frowned.
Ai nudged him. "Well? What’s the verdict? Are we planning an intervention?"
Shinchan didn’t answer.
Because for the first time, he wasn’t sure how he felt about this.
Continued in Chapter 78.

they followed, it was hilarious for ai. they entered in the cafe too. then like a spy shin caught kazama in the washroom of the cafe.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 78 – A Mission Behind Enemy Lines
Ai was having the time of her life.
She was practically vibrating with excitement as she and Shinchan crept through the café entrance, trying to be as discreet as possible. But it was hard to be subtle when Shinchan—who usually couldn’t care less about most things—was suddenly on a full-blown stealth mission.
"This is so much fun," Ai whispered, practically giddy. "I feel like I’m in a spy movie."
"Shut up," Shinchan muttered, pulling his hoodie over his head. "We can’t let them see us."
Ai snorted. "You do realize you’re, like, the most recognizable person in school, right? The moment you open your mouth, the whole café will know it's you.*"
Shinchan ignored her.
They took a seat at a table near the back, grabbing menus and using them as makeshift shields to peek at Kazama and Himawari.
"Ohhh," Ai whispered, nudging him. "Look at that, he’s pouring her tea. So refined, so charming—*"
Shinchan growled. "Stop enjoying this."
Ai smirked. "Oh, I love this."
Shinchan was too busy glaring at Kazama to retaliate. His best friend—the guy who had always been by-the-book, the guy who always scolded him for flirting—was sitting there, making his little sister smile.
Unacceptable.
Just then, Kazama stood up.
"He’s heading to the washroom," Ai whispered. "This is your chance!"
Shinchan slammed his menu down. "I’m going in."
Ai gasped dramatically. "Be careful, agent. The enemy is formidable."
Shinchan rolled his eyes and walked off, leaving Ai giggling behind him.
—
Kazama barely had time to react before Shinchan pinned him against the bathroom wall.
"Explain yourself," Shinchan demanded.
"Wha—?!" Kazama sputtered. "Shinchan?! What are you doing—"
"Why are you on a date with my sister?!"
Kazama blinked. "It’s not a date!"
"Then why are you here alone with her, pouring her tea like you’re some rich, eligible bachelor?"
"B-Because I am a rich, eligible bachelor?!"
Shinchan scowled. "Wrong answer."
Kazama sighed, rubbing his temples. "Look, Himawari just wanted to hang out and talk. We ran into each other while shopping, and she invited me here. That’s all it is."
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. "Do you swear?"
Kazama hesitated.
Too long.
"You hesitated."*
"B-Because you’re being ridiculous!"*
Shinchan stared at him for a long moment, then suddenly smirked. "Well, well, well. Look at you, Kazama. Who would’ve thought you’d be this bold?"
Kazama groaned. "It’s not like that—"
The bathroom door swung open.
An innocent café customer walked in, only to see one high school boy pinning another against the wall, both looking extremely serious.
There was an awkward pause.
Then the man slowly backed out of the restroom without a word.
Shinchan and Kazama stared at each other.
Kazama groaned again. "I hate you."
Shinchan grinned. "Good. Now let’s go back before Ai gets any ideas."
—
They returned to the table, where Ai was barely holding in her laughter.
"So?" she asked, resting her chin on her hands. "Did you two work things out in the bathroom?"
Shinchan sat down with a sigh. "It’s classified information."
Kazama sat down too, looking absolutely drained. "I hate my life."
Ai giggled. "Good. Now, let’s keep watching your sister and Kazama like total creeps."
Shinchan groaned. "I hate this."
But he kept watching.
Because there was no way he was letting this slide.
Continued in Chapter 79.
You said:
he let them be for now. and went home with ai. realising he also spent all of today with her.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 79 – Just the Two of Us... Again?
Shinchan eventually let it go.
For now.
He shot Kazama one last warning glance before sighing and stretching his arms. "Alright, I’m done babysitting. Let’s go, Ai."
Ai raised an eyebrow. "You’re just letting them be?"
"I’ll interrogate her at home."
Ai smirked. "Wow. You really are the overprotective big brother stereotype."
"And proud of it," Shinchan replied without shame.
They left the café, stepping into the cool evening air. The rain from earlier had stopped, leaving the streets damp and glowing under the soft city lights.
Ai hummed beside him, swaying slightly as she walked. "You know... I just realized something."
"What?"
"We’ve been together all day."
Shinchan blinked.
Now that she mentioned it...
They had met by chance at the store. Then they had walked around, gone shopping, followed Kazama and Himawari, and even had a little stakeout in the café.
It had been just the two of them.
Shinchan shoved his hands into his pockets. "Huh. You’re right."
Ai tilted her head at him, watching for a reaction. "And?"
"And what?"
"Does that make your heart race, Shin?" she teased.
Shinchan yawned. "Nope."
Ai pouted. "Tch. Not even a little?"
Shinchan smirked. "Maybe if you were cuter."
Ai punched his arm. "You jerk!"
He laughed, rubbing his arm where she hit him. "That one actually hurt, damn."
Ai huffed, crossing her arms. "You better realize it soon, Mr. President. I won’t wait forever."
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "Realize what?"
Ai rolled her eyes. "Nothing."
They kept walking.
And for some reason, even though they had spent all day together, neither of them really felt like rushing home.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 80 – The Game of Life
The student council office was packed.
Not because of some urgent meeting. Not because of some disciplinary issue.
But because it was boiling outside.
The relentless summer sun had turned the school into an oven, and the student council office was the only place with an air conditioner powerful enough to make it barely bearable.
And, of course, that meant it was everyone’s refuge.
Shinchan’s usual group was sprawled around the office as usual, but today, they weren’t alone.
Rika Miyamoto, the vice captain of the kendo club, had somehow made herself comfortable, leaning against a desk with her arms crossed.
Minami, the previous student council president, was lounging on the couch with an annoyingly relaxed grin, as if he still owned the place.
And then there was Hayashi—their old election rival—who had somehow slipped in without an invitation.
"Why is he here?" Shinchan deadpanned, pointing at Hayashi.
"It’s hot." Hayashi shrugged, fanning himself with a notebook. "You wouldn’t deny someone suffering in this heat, would you, President?"
Shinchan groaned. "This is why we need a bouncer for the council room."
"I was the bouncer," Minami chimed in from the couch, smirking. "You guys are too soft. Back in my day—"
"Shut up, old man." Shinchan threw a pillow at him.
Before another argument could start, Ai clapped her hands. "Okay, instead of roasting each other, why don’t we play a game?"
"A game?" Kazama adjusted his glasses. "What kind of game?"
"The Game of Life."
There was a brief silence.
Then Nene grinned. "Like the anime?"
Ai nodded. "Exactly."*
The group immediately got excited.
"But first," Shinchan leaned back in his chair. "Masao, Nene, go buy drinks and ice cream for everyone."*
"Why us?" Masao whined.
"Because you two lost rock-paper-scissors earlier," Shinchan reminded him.
Grumbling, Masao and Nene stood up and left for the store.
Meanwhile…
As they walked down the street, the sun glared down mercilessly.
"Ugh, this heat is insane," Nene complained, using her hand as a shield against the sun.
Masao wiped the sweat off his forehead. "Why did we get stuck with this?"
"Because we’re idiots who lost rock-paper-scissors," Nene sighed.
They finally reached the store and picked out a mix of ice cream flavors and drinks. As they lined up to pay, Nene noticed Masao staring at something.
"What?" she asked, following his gaze.
It was a couple outside, sharing an ice cream cone. The girl was laughing, wiping a bit of melted ice cream off the guy’s cheek.
Masao turned away quickly, his face a little red. "Nothing."
Nene smirked. "You want to share an ice cream with me, Masao?"
Masao choked on air. "W-WHAT?!"
Nene burst out laughing. "Relax, I was joking."
But for some reason, Masao couldn’t look her in the eye.
Back at the Council Office
"Finally!" Shinchan stretched as Masao and Nene returned, dumping the ice cream and drinks on the table. "Let’s get started."
They set up the board, deciding on characters for the game.
"Alright, let’s see…" Ai scanned the pieces. "Who do you want to be, Shin?"
Shinchan smirked. "The rich playboy."*
Ai rolled her eyes. "Obviously."*
Kazama chose the ambitious businessman role, while Nene picked the aspiring actress. Masao somehow ended up as a struggling artist, Bo was the mysterious wanderer, and Hayashi picked the corrupt politician (which was fitting).
Then there was Rika, who simply shrugged and took the warrior princess role.
And Minami? He chose the old man who just wants peace.
"Alright, let’s roll."
The dice hit the board, and the Game of Life began.
Chaos ensued.
Kazama tried to play seriously, calculating every move. Shinchan sabotaged him at every turn.
Ai kept choosing the most dramatic life decisions, somehow becoming both a famous idol and a mafia boss.
Masao and Nene ended up getting married in the game, which led to a lot of teasing.
"Divorce! I want a divorce!" Nene yelled when Masao accidentally lost all their money in fake stocks.
"It was an accident!" Masao wailed.
"You ruined our fake marriage!"
Meanwhile, Bo was suspiciously lucky with his rolls, somehow landing on all the best career paths. No one knew how, but Bo had basically won the game before anyone else.
By the end of it, Shinchan was bankrupt, Ai was a crime lord, Kazama was still bitter, and Nene and Masao had fake-divorced three times.
And Minami? He had somehow actually retired in peace.
"I hate this game," Shinchan groaned.
Ai smirked. "You just hate losing."*
Shinchan threw another pillow at her.
Outside, the sun finally began to set, cooling the air a little. But inside, the council office remained as chaotic as ever.
And somehow, despite everything, it was one of the most fun days they had in a long time.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 81 – Boys Talk, Girls Talk
As they stepped out of the student council office, stretching after hours of chaos, they ran into someone unexpected.
"Minami!" A cheerful voice called out.
A young woman with shoulder-length dark brown hair, sharp eyes, and a confident smile approached them. She was wearing casual summer clothes—a simple white blouse and denim shorts—looking effortlessly cool.
Minami’s face immediately lit up. "Oh, hey!" He casually put an arm around her shoulders. "Everyone, meet my girlfriend, Akari Hayase."*
Ai’s eyes widened. "Wait. The Akari Hayase?"
"Former vice president Akari Hayase?" Kazama asked, adjusting his glasses.
Akari smirked. "That’s me."*
Minami grinned. "We started dating after we got into office. It was inevitable, really. With my charm and her sharp mind, we made the perfect team."*
Ai scoffed. "More like she ran the council while you slacked off."*
Akari laughed, giving Minami a playful nudge. "That’s not entirely wrong."*
Shinchan smirked. "So let me get this straight. The student council president and vice president got together after working together?"
Kazama’s eyes flickered with realization.
Ai gasped.
The entire group turned to Shinchan and Kazama at the same time.
There was a beat of silence before Masao grinned. "Ohhh, I see what’s happening here."*
Nene smirked. "This totally checks out."*
"History is repeating itself," Rika added, nodding sagely.
"Give it a year," Hayashi snickered. "We’re gonna be attending their wedding."*
"SHUT UP!" Both Kazama and Shinchan snapped in unison.
Akari tilted her head. "Wait, wait, hold on…" She looked at the two. "You’re the new president and vice president?"
Minami grinned, wrapping an arm around Akari’s shoulder. "Oh, this is hilarious."
"We are not dating!" Kazama protested, flustered.
"Yeah, yeah, sure," Minami said with a knowing smirk. "That’s what I said too."*
Ai, on the other hand, was looking way too smug.
"Let’s go," Shinchan muttered. "Before these people ruin my reputation."*
"What reputation?" Nene asked.
"EXACTLY!"*
They finally split into two groups, the boys walking together down the street while the girls lagged behind.
Boys Talk
As soon as they were out of earshot, Kazama groaned, rubbing his temples. "I cannot believe that just happened."*
Masao, still grinning, leaned toward Shinchan. "Sooo… You and Ai, huh?*"
Shinchan gave him a deadpan look. "Masao, I will end you."*
Bo, who had been quiet the entire time, simply nodded. "It makes sense."*
Kazama shot Bo a betrayed look. "NOT YOU TOO!"*
"Oh, come on, Shin," Hayashi said, throwing an arm over Shinchan’s shoulder. "You don’t seriously expect us to believe you don’t feel anything?"
Shinchan rolled his eyes. "Believe whatever you want. I have nothing to say."*
"That just makes you sound guiltier," Kazama muttered.
"What about you, Kazama?" Masao wiggled his eyebrows. "Hima-chan, huh?"
Kazama froze.
Shinchan’s head snapped toward him so fast he almost got whiplash.
"Wait. What?"
Masao immediately realized he shouldn’t have said that.
Kazama turned to glare at him, his face red. "MASAO."*
But Shinchan was already cracking his knuckles. "Kazamaaa~" His voice was way too cheerful. "Care to explain?"
"There is nothing to explain!" Kazama said, his voice slightly higher than usual. "Your sister and I are just—"
"Spending time together?" Shinchan’s grin widened. "Alone? In a café?"
"IT WAS NOT A DATE!"*
"You sound awfully defensive," Bo said.
"THAT’S BECAUSE YOU IDIOTS ARE MAKING IT WEIRD!"*
Shinchan slowly draped an arm around Kazama. "Kazama… my dear, dear friend…"
Kazama gulped. "Shinchan, whatever you’re thinking, don’t—"
"My little sister?" Shinchan whispered dramatically. "My baby sister?"
"I swear, Shin, it’s not—"
"What are your intentions?"
"OH MY GOD."*
The group died laughing as Kazama buried his face in his hands.
"This is bullying," Kazama muttered.
"This is justice," Shinchan corrected. "You don’t get to judge me for Ai while you’re out here getting cozy with my sister."
Kazama groaned. "I hate all of you."*
Shinchan patted his back. "Love you too, buddy."*
Girls Talk
Meanwhile, on the other side…
"So," Nene started, linking arms with Ai. "You and Shin, huh?"
Ai immediately turned red. "I—! That—!"*
"Ohoho," Rika smirked. "She’s panicking."*
"I am NOT panicking!"*
"She’s panicking," Minami’s girlfriend, Akari, confirmed.
"I knew something was up when Shin did the kabe-don," Nene teased. "He’s never that assertive."
"I mean," Rika shrugged. "He did grab her face on stage during Romeo and Juliet."*
Ai covered her face. "DON’T BRING THAT UP!"*
"You’ve been teasing him for weeks," Nene pointed out. "But what happens when he starts playing the game?"
"I—I wasn’t expecting it!"* Ai admitted, still red. "It’s not fair! Shin’s not supposed to flirt back!"*
Akari smirked. "And yet, here we are."*
Ai groaned. "This is so unfair."*
"Welcome to our world, sweetheart," Minami’s girlfriend said. "You’re falling for him, aren’t you?"
Ai froze.
For the first time, she couldn’t answer.
And that was an answer in itself.
The girls all grinned.
"Ohohoho," Nene smirked. "This is gonna be fun."*
As the boys and girls continued their separate conversations, one thing was clear.
This summer…
Things were getting very interesting.

Chapter 82 – The Sports Day Nightmare Begins
The calm before the storm didn’t last long.
The next morning, as soon as Shinchan and Kazama stepped into the student council office, they were ambushed.
"President! Vice President!"
A stack of papers was shoved into their hands before they could even process what was happening. A group of students, looking way too enthusiastic for a Monday morning, were practically vibrating with excitement.
"We need your approval for the Sports Day budget!"
"And the event schedule!"*
"And the relay team selections!"*
"And the cheerleading performance lineup!"*
Shinchan blinked, glancing down at the mountain of paperwork. "…Hah?"
Kazama, still half-asleep, stared blankly at the students. "Why are you bringing this to us? This is supposed to be handled by the event committee."*
"It is!"* one of the students nodded eagerly. "But the final approval has to come from the student council!"*
Ai entered the office with a bright smile. "Good morning, everyone!"* Then she saw the pile of paperwork. "Oh."*
Shinchan immediately shoved half the stack into her arms. "You’re part of this too, Treasurer Ai-chan."*
"W-Wait, why am I—?"*
"Welcome to hell," Kazama muttered.
The Chaos Begins
For the next few hours, the student council office turned into a battlefield.
"We need more funding for the relay uniforms!"*
"Denied!"* Shinchan stamped the paper without reading it.
"W-Wait! You didn’t even look at—"
"Don’t care. Next."*
"We need permission to build an obstacle course involving water balloons and slippery mats!"*
Kazama looked up from his stack. "That sounds dangerous."
"That sounds awesome," Shinchan corrected. "Approved."*
"No, we are not approving—"
"Too late, I already stamped it."*
"DAMN IT, SHIN! STOP ABUSING YOUR POWER!"*
Ai sighed, sorting through a different set of requests. "Do we really need a cheerleading fight performance?"
"What even is a cheerleading fight?" Kazama asked, horrified.
"Apparently, it's when the cheerleaders of different classes battle with choreographed moves…" Ai squinted at the proposal. "…in the middle of a relay race."*
"That sounds amazing," Shinchan said. "Approved."*
"We are going to get sued," Kazama groaned.
Meanwhile, The Rest of the Group…
Outside the student council room, Nene, Masao, Bo, and Rika from the Kendo Club were watching through the window.
"They look like they’re suffering," Bo noted.
"Should we help?" Masao asked.
Nene smirked. "Nope. This is entertainment."
"But it is sports day," Rika added. "We should probably figure out what we’re doing for it."*
"Oh, that’s easy," Nene said. "Shinchan’s probably gonna get roped into some event, Kazama’s gonna be forced into the relay, and Ai’s gonna do something extra just to mess with Shinchan."*
Masao blinked. "You… already predicted all that?"
"Oh, absolutely."*
Back inside the office, Kazama slammed his hands on the desk. "I REFUSE TO BE IN THE RELAY RACE!"*
The event committee students just handed him a pre-filled form. "Too bad, we already signed you up."*
Ai giggled. "You were saying, Nene?"
Nene smirked. "Called it."*

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 83 – Ai’s Realization
The afternoon sun bathed the sports field in a golden hue as the student council and their friends stood near the sidelines, watching the cheerleading teams go through their practice routines. The different classes were preparing their performances, each trying to outdo the others with synchronized moves, acrobatics, and, of course, questionable amounts of school spirit.
Shinchan leaned against the fence, watching the scene unfold with a lazy expression.
"Alright, so we just need to give our approval," Kazama said, flipping through his clipboard. "As long as everything looks safe and within the budget, we can move on."*
"Look at them go!" Masao clapped his hands, eyes shining with excitement. "That pyramid formation is insane!"*
"They’re good," Nene nodded, arms crossed. "But is this really necessary?"
"Cheerleaders are essential for morale, Nene-chan!"* Bo said, unusually animated. "This is the spirit of sports day!"*
Ai stood beside Shinchan, hands on her hips, watching the practice unfold. But as the routines continued, she started to notice something.
Shinchan wasn’t just watching the practice—he was staring at the girls.
Not in an overly obvious way, but Ai knew him too well. His eyes followed the movements of the cheerleaders, lingering slightly on certain individuals as they twirled and flipped. His expression didn’t change, but there was a familiar flicker in his gaze.
It was the same as when they were kids.
A memory flashed in her mind.
—Five-year-old Shinchan sitting in the sandbox, watching a group of girls play nearby. Ai, excited to show him a flower she picked, ran up to him, only to realize he wasn’t even paying attention to her. Instead, his eyes were locked on a girl doing cartwheels in the grass. She had pouted back then, stomping her foot in frustration.—
And now, years later, it was happening again.
Ai's eye twitched.
"…What exactly are you looking at?" she asked sweetly.
Shinchan blinked, glancing at her. "Huh? What?"
Ai narrowed her eyes. "Are you watching the formations… or the girls?"
"Formations, obviously," Shinchan replied, completely deadpan.
Ai squinted. "…You’re lying."*
"No, I’m not."*
"Yes, you are."*
Kazama turned toward them. "What are you two whispering about?"
"Shin’s wandering eyes," Ai muttered darkly.
"Hah?" Kazama looked between them. "Wandering eyes?"
"Oi, oi, don’t make it sound weird," Shinchan huffed. "I was just watching the routines. It’s my duty as student council president to ensure everything is running smoothly."*
"Oh, so it’s your duty now?" Ai said, smiling through gritted teeth. "What about me, huh? I could be performing out there, and you wouldn’t even notice!"*
Shinchan tilted his head. "…You wanna be a cheerleader?"
"THAT'S NOT THE POINT!"*
The group turned to stare at them.
"What’s going on?" Nene asked.
"Ai-chan is jealous," Bo observed.
"I AM NOT JEALOUS!"* Ai yelled.
Shinchan smirked. "Sounds pretty jealous to me, Ai-chan."*
Ai crossed her arms, her cheeks puffing slightly. "If I was jealous, it would only be because my best friend is ignoring me in favor of other girls. That’s what’s frustrating!"*
"Right, right," Shinchan said, clearly enjoying himself. "Not because you secretly want me to stare at you instead?"
Ai opened her mouth. Closed it.
Her face turned red.
Nene raised an eyebrow. "Wow. That was bold, even for Shin."*
Masao gasped. "Did he just reverse uno Ai-chan?!"
"Incredible," Bo nodded.
Ai fumed.
Shinchan leaned against the fence, clearly pleased with himself. "Let’s finish up this approval thing and move on. I think we should check out the obstacle course next."*
"Oh, sure, let’s just move on," Ai huffed. "Like you didn’t just say that."
Shinchan chuckled, hands in his pockets as he walked away. Ai glared at his back, gripping her clipboard a little too tightly.
‘Fine, Shin-chan. If that’s how you wanna play…’
She smirked.
‘Then let’s see how you handle me turning things up a notch.’

Chapter 84 – The Silent Treatment
Shinchan had made a miscalculation.
He had teased Ai plenty of times before, and she had always played along, shooting back her own flirtatious remarks with that playful smirk of hers. It was their usual dynamic—she chased, he evaded. She pushed, he dodged.
But this time…
She was actually mad.
And he didn't realize it until after school, when he was at relay practice with Kazama.
The sports festival was just around the corner, and as part of his duties as student council president (or rather, because of some unfortunate paperwork trickery), he had been roped into running in the relay race.
It wasn’t too bad. He was fast. The real issue was—
"Oi, focus!"
A baton smacked against Shinchan’s head.
"Tch—!" He winced, rubbing the spot as he turned to glare at Kazama. "What the hell was that for?!"
Kazama crossed his arms. "You’re distracted. That’s the third time you messed up the handoff. Are you even taking this seriously?"
"I am," Shinchan muttered, rolling his shoulders. "It’s just…"
Kazama raised an eyebrow. "Just what?"
Shinchan hesitated. His eyes flicked toward the edge of the field, scanning for a familiar brown-haired girl.
She wasn’t there.
Ai always stuck around after school, whether it was for student council work, watching club activities, or just because. Even when she wasn’t needed, she found some excuse to linger.
But today, she was nowhere to be seen.
And Shinchan, for some reason, noticed.
Kazama followed his gaze. "Looking for Ai-chan?"
Shinchan clicked his tongue. "No."*
Kazama smirked. "Oh? You’re saying that, but your eyes say otherwise."*
"Shut up," Shinchan muttered, stretching his legs. "She’s probably just busy."*
Kazama hummed, clearly not buying it. "Riiight. Or maybe… she’s avoiding you."*
Shinchan froze for a split second.
Kazama’s smirk widened. "Ohh. I see. What did you do this time?"
"Nothing," Shinchan said quickly.
"Uh-huh."*
"Seriously, nothing."*
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Did you tease her too much again?"
Shinchan scoffed. "Tch. Like that’d make her mad."*
Kazama gave him a look. "Shinchan. You’re dense, but you’re not that dense. What did you say?"
Shinchan exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck. "I may have implied that she was jealous when she wasn’t."*
Kazama stared. "…Are you an idiot?"
"Oi."*
"No, seriously, are you an actual idiot?" Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. "Do you want to die?"
"She’s overreacting," Shinchan grumbled, flipping the baton between his fingers. "She teases me all the time. It’s only fair I return the favor."*
"There’s a difference between playful teasing and saying something that actually upsets her, you moron."*
Shinchan frowned. "It’s not that serious… right?"
"Let’s see," Kazama began listing on his fingers. "She wasn’t at practice, she didn’t wait for you after school, and she hasn’t texted you all day. That’s basically a death sentence in Ai-chan language."*
Shinchan clicked his tongue. "Tch. She’ll get over it."*
Kazama shook his head. "Shin. If Ai-chan is actually mad at you, you need to fix it. Do you have any idea how terrifying she can be when she wants to be?"
Shinchan crossed his arms, looking away. "It’s fine. She’ll be back to normal by tomorrow."*
Kazama sighed, adjusting his glasses. "Whatever you say. Just don’t come crying to me when she really makes you suffer."*
Shinchan rolled his eyes and got back into position for the next round of practice.
But as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the school field, he couldn’t shake the nagging feeling in the back of his mind.
She was mad.
And for the first time in a while…
It actually bothered him.

as the days continued this treatment also continues, but the thing even worse was that she during work and here and there was surrounded by boys, with shin not present there. making him feel uneasy too.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 85 – Uneasy Feelings
The silent treatment continued.
Day after day, Ai acted as if Shinchan didn’t exist.
At first, he thought she was just messing with him, playing hard to get in some weird, roundabout way. But as the days stretched on, and she still didn’t acknowledge him, he realized—
She was actually ignoring him.
It was… annoying.
More annoying than he expected.
Even during student council meetings, where they had to interact, Ai kept things strictly professional. She addressed him as "President Nohara" with the same polite tone she used with teachers. No teasing. No smug smirks. No playful prods.
Just cold, detached formality.
It was weird.
And worse than that…
Whenever Shinchan wasn’t around, she was constantly surrounded by guys.
"What do you mean she went out for lunch with some guys from Class 2-B?!" Shinchan nearly dropped his chopsticks.
Kazama gave him a deadpan look. "Exactly what I said. Apparently, a few upperclassmen invited her to lunch, and she accepted."*
Shinchan scowled, stabbing at his rice. "Since when does she hang out with them?"
"I don’t know," Kazama shrugged. "But she’s been getting a lot of attention lately. She’s popular, you know?"
Shinchan muttered under his breath, chewing aggressively.
And it wasn’t just lunch.
She had guys approaching her in the hallways, asking if she needed help carrying things. She was chatting with classmates during breaks. Even during PE, she was grouped up with a bunch of guys he didn’t know.
And Shinchan hated that he noticed.
He hated that he cared.
He wasn’t jealous. Obviously.
He was just…
Irritated.
Yeah. That was it.
Irritated.
Not jealous.
Not at all.

Chapter 86 – The Breaking Point
It had been nearly a week of this now.
A full week of Ai giving him the cold shoulder while hanging around other guys.
Shinchan had tried to ignore it. He really had. But every time he saw her laughing with someone else, every time she completely pretended like he wasn’t there, something inside him twisted.
It was starting to piss him off.
And today?
Today was the breaking point.
The student council was working late to finalize everything for sports day. The air in the room was stuffy, the paperwork was endless, and the atmosphere was buzzing with stress.
But what really pushed Shinchan over the edge—
—was when one of the guys who’d been hanging around Ai recently walked into the office and offered her a drink.
"Ai-chan, I got you this from the vending machine," the guy, Yuto from Class 2-C, said with a way too friendly smile, placing a chilled bottle of green tea on her desk.
And she accepted it with a smile.
A real smile.
"Oh, thanks, Yuto-kun!" she said, her voice way too sweet.
Shinchan clenched his jaw.
Yuto.
This guy again.
This guy who had been trailing around Ai all week like a lost puppy.
This guy who, apparently, was a former middle school acquaintance of hers.
And Ai was letting it happen.
She was smiling at him, chatting with him, accepting drinks from him.
Shinchan slammed his pen down. "Oi."
The whole room went silent.
Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Bo-chan all froze.
Ai blinked, turning to look at him, pretending like she had no idea why he was suddenly glaring at her. "What?"
Shinchan stood up, chair scraping against the floor. "Outside. Now."
Ai raised an eyebrow. "Excuse me?"
"I said outside," he repeated, voice dangerously calm.
The others exchanged nervous glances.
"Uhh… maybe we should—" Masao started, but Kazama shook his head.
"Let them be," Kazama muttered.
Ai exhaled dramatically. "Fine."
She got up, following Shinchan out into the hallway.
As soon as the door shut behind them, Shinchan turned to her, arms crossed. "Alright, what the hell is your problem?"
Ai blinked. "My problem?"
"Yeah, your problem," he snapped. "You’ve been acting weird all week. Ignoring me. Hanging out with other guys. Acting like I don’t exist. What’s your deal?"
Ai gave him a mockingly thoughtful look. "Hmm, I wonder why? Maybe it has something to do with how you were ogling other girls the other day?"
Shinchan blinked. "…What?"
"Oh, don’t play dumb," she huffed, crossing her arms. "You were totally checking out the cheerleaders. I saw you."
Shinchan rolled his eyes. "I wasn’t checking them out. I was watching them. Y’know, like a student council president approving an activity?"
"Uh-huh, sure," Ai deadpanned. "And that’s why your eyes were practically glued to their skirts?"
Shinchan groaned. "You know that’s not what happened. You’re just making a big deal out of nothing.*"
"Oh really?" Ai scoffed. "Then why do you care so much about me talking to other guys?"
"*I don’t," Shinchan shot back way too fast.
Ai smirked. "Oh? Then why are we even having this conversation?"
Shinchan opened his mouth. Closed it.
Damn it.
She had a point.
He was reacting to this way more than he should.
And that realization pissed him off even more.
Ai took a step closer, tilting her head. "Are you jealous, Shin-chan?"
"Pfft. Jealous?" He scoffed. "Please. You wish I was jealous."
"Mmm…" Ai narrowed her eyes, scanning his face. "Then why are you glaring at me like you wanna throw me off the rooftop?"
"Because you’re annoying," he grumbled.
Ai smirked. "Awww, poor Shin-chan. Can’t handle a little payback?"
Shinchan clenched his jaw.
This girl.
This damn girl.
She was so irritating.
But also—
His heart was beating way too fast.
Finally, he let out a sigh, rubbing the back of his neck. "Alright, fine. Maybe I was staring too much that day. Maybe."
Ai raised an eyebrow. "And?"
"And… maybe I did get a little annoyed seeing you surrounded by guys," he admitted begrudgingly. "But that’s not jealousy. It’s just—"
"Possessiveness?" Ai supplied, grinning.
Shinchan shot her a look. "Stop putting words in my mouth."
Ai giggled. "I’m just saying, Shin-chan~ If you were jealous, it’d be kinda cute."
Shinchan rolled his eyes. "You’re impossible."
Ai smiled, the real, genuine kind. "And you’re predictable."
They stood there for a moment, the tension between them finally dissipating.
Then Ai nudged his arm. "So? Are we good now?"
Shinchan sighed. "Yeah. We’re good."
"Great," Ai said cheerfully. "Now, let’s go back before Kazama and the others start placing bets on what happened out here."
Shinchan smirked. "Too late. Kazama definitely already has a whole betting pool going."
They turned to head back inside, but before they did, Ai leaned in just slightly, lowering her voice.
"For the record, Shin-chan…" she whispered, lips curving into a teasing smile. "You’re kinda cute when you’re flustered."
Shinchan felt heat rush to his ears. "Shut up."
And just like that, things were back to normal.

Chapter 87 – The Final Countdown
Sports day was just around the corner, and the entire school was buzzing with energy. Banners were being painted, practice sessions were in full swing, and student council members were practically drowning in last-minute preparations.
And yet—
Somewhere amidst all the chaos, something else was brewing.
Masao and Nene.
Shinchan had noticed it over the past few weeks.
It was subtle at first—small moments that could easily be brushed off as coincidences.
Nene would somehow always end up next to Masao when they sat together as a group.
Masao, usually scared of confrontation, had started standing his ground a little more when dealing with Nene’s usual antics.
And most importantly—
They were bickering less.
Which, for them, was very suspicious.
"Oi, Masao," Shinchan called as they sat in the student council room, reviewing the final schedule. "What’s with you and Nene?"
Masao choked on his drink. "W-What?"
Kazama, who had been flipping through the event list, raised an eyebrow. "You’ve been acting weird around her."
Bo-chan, ever observant, nodded in agreement. "Different vibe."
Masao looked around, sweating. "I-I don’t know what you guys are talking about! Nene and I are the same as always!"
Shinchan smirked. "Uh-huh. Sure."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Actually, now that I think about it, you two are both participating in the three-legged race together, aren’t you?"
Masao paled. "T-That was just a random draw!"
Shinchan leaned in, eyes gleaming with mischief. "Suuure it was."
Masao groaned. "I swear, it was!"
But no one believed him.
—
Meanwhile…
Nene was dealing with her own set of problems.
"Ugh, this three-legged race is so stupid!" she groaned, stretching her legs. "Why do I have to be paired with him?"
Ai, sitting nearby, smirked. "Him? Or Masao?"
Nene twitched. "Same thing."
Minami, the former student council president who had randomly dropped in to visit, laughed. "You know, for someone who complains about him so much, you sure do spend a lot of time thinking about him."
Nene scoffed. "Excuse me?"
Ai giggled. "She’s not wrong, though."
"You guys are ridiculous!" Nene folded her arms. "Like I would ever—"
At that exact moment, Masao passed by outside, adjusting his practice uniform.
Nene immediately went silent.
Ai and Minami exchanged glances.
Then—
"Oh my God." Ai gasped. "You totally have a crush on him."
Nene turned red. "I DO NOT."
Minami nodded, completely ignoring her. "Yup, it’s happening. The tsundere has fallen."
"I SAID I DIDN’T!"
But they both knew.
And Nene hated that they knew.
—
Later that evening
Shinchan found Masao sitting outside near the vending machines, looking way too deep in thought.
"Oi," Shinchan said, kicking his foot lightly. "You good?"
Masao sighed. "What if I mess up the race?"
Shinchan snorted. "It’s a three-legged race, Masao. It’s not that deep."
"Yeah, but…" Masao hesitated. "Nene actually wants to win. And if I screw up, she’ll kill me."
Shinchan thought for a moment, then smirked. "You like her, don’t you?"
Masao choked again. "W-WHAT?!"
Shinchan stretched lazily. "You heard me."
Masao panicked. "N-No! I— I mean, she’s— She’s Nene! She’s scary! She’s mean! She yells a lot! She—"
"And yet," Shinchan interrupted, "you don’t seem to mind it as much anymore."
Masao opened his mouth. Closed it.
Damn it.
Shinchan was right.
Before he could respond, Nene’s voice rang from the distance. "MASAO! WE HAVE TO PRACTICE!"
Masao sighed. "Pray for me."
Shinchan grinned. "You’re already dead, buddy."
As Masao ran off to his doom, Shinchan leaned back against the vending machine, watching them bicker as they practiced.
Yeah.
This was definitely going to be fun to watch.

Chapter 88 – Masao’s Ultimate Trial
It was supposed to be just a simple practice session.
But somehow, the entire group had gathered to “observe.”
Shinchan, Ai, Kazama, Bo-chan.
Minami, Hayashi, Rika, and Akari.
All of them were standing in a loose circle, watching Masao and Nene struggle through their three-legged race practice.
"How did this turn into a whole event?" Masao whispered to Nene.
"You tell me!" she hissed back, glancing at their audience.
They had barely taken three steps before collapsing for the seventh time in the last fifteen minutes.
Shinchan shook his head. "Pathetic."
"I feel secondhand embarrassment," Ai added.
"They're doomed," Hayashi muttered.
"Actually," Rika crossed her arms, analyzing the situation, "Masao’s biggest issue is that he’s trying too hard to maintain distance while running."
Minami smirked. "Well, there’s an obvious solution to that, isn’t there?"
Kazama nodded. "They need to reduce the distance between them."
Ai snapped her fingers. "Masao needs to hold Nene’s waist!"
Silence.
Masao froze.
Nene twitched.
"What?" they both said at the same time.
Rika nodded. "It’s the best way to balance. Otherwise, you’ll keep falling."
"No way!" Nene crossed her arms. "We’re not doing that!"
Masao vigorously shook his head. "Yeah! There’s gotta be another way!"
"There isn’t," Minami said with a completely straight face.
"Nope," Hayashi confirmed.
Shinchan smirked. "Or you could keep falling like losers. Your call."
Masao and Nene exchanged horrified glances.
Neither of them wanted to admit it, but…
The group was right.
Masao gulped. "Fine…"
Nene gritted her teeth. "Fine."

Attempt #8 – The ‘Ultimate’ Strategy
Masao hesitated for a full five seconds before awkwardly placing his hands on Nene’s waist.
Nene immediately stiffened. "H-Hey! Not so tight!"
"I’M TRYING!" Masao squeaked.
Their audience looked way too entertained.
"This is better than a rom-com," Akari whispered to Ai.
"This is a rom-com," Ai whispered back.
"Shut up!" Nene snapped at them.
"Move already!" Hayashi called.
And so, they took a step.
Then another.
And…
For the first time, they didn’t fall.
Then—
They actually started running properly.
"OH, THEY’RE DOING IT!" Ai cheered.
Kazama nodded. "Looks like it’s working."
Shinchan grinned. "And they said they wouldn’t do it."
Nene and Masao focused on the rhythm.
Left. Right. Left. Right.
It was working.
Until—
"MASAO, DON’T LET GO!"
"I’M NOT LETTING GO—"
And then—
THUD.
They collapsed again.
But this time—
Masao had fallen on top of Nene.
Directly.
Silence.
"Oh?" Minami smirked.
"Scandalous," Ai teased.
Nene and Masao turned red.
"GET OFF ME!"
"S-SORRY!"
Shinchan sighed. "At this rate, we’ll finish school before they finish this race."
Masao groaned.
This was going to be the longest practice of his life.

Chapter 89 – The Heat of Practice
The school grounds were alive with the chaos of practice.
Shinchan exhaled, shaking out his legs before taking his position for the relay race. Kazama was beside him, stretching his arms, his face set in the usual determined expression.
"Try not to screw up," Kazama muttered.
Shinchan smirked. "I could say the same to you."
On the other side of the field, Masao and Nene were still struggling with their three-legged race, with Masao now hesitantly placing his hand on Nene’s waist while she barked instructions at him.
"LEFT! I SAID LEFT, YOU IDIOT!"
"THIS IS LEFT!"
"NOT MY LEFT!"
Rika, watching from the sidelines, sighed. "They’re never winning at this rate."
"Maybe if they get a head start of, like, five minutes," Bo-chan offered.
Meanwhile, Ai stood in the archery range, adjusting her grip on the bowstring. She pulled back, fingers steady, eyes locked on the target.
Breathe in…
She released the arrow—
THWACK.
A perfect shot.
The group whistled in appreciation, but Ai barely reacted. She was still mildly annoyed from her unfinished war with Shin. She knew he was watching other girls during the cheerleading approval, and she was still holding it against him.
And speaking of Shin…
He had to rush over to another part of the field to spar with Rika for the Kendo demonstration. The moment he entered the makeshift arena, she was already waiting for him, shinai in hand.
"No mercy, President," she warned.
Shinchan grinned. "Wouldn’t have it any other way."
Their wooden swords clashed, a sharp, resounding crack that turned heads across the field. Shinchan had to admit—Rika was fast. But he was used to speed. He blocked, sidestepped, and countered.
Meanwhile, Bo-chan was across the field, preparing for the long jump event. His movements were slow, deliberate. But the moment he took off, he soared through the air with an effortless ease that stunned even some of the seniors watching.
"…He’s like a frog," Kazama murmured, watching from the relay track.
"A majestic frog," Shinchan corrected.
Bo-chan landed smoothly, brushing the dirt off his uniform as if nothing happened. The entire group nodded in silent approval.
On the side, Hayashi and Minami were also practicing their respective events—sprint and javelin. Minami took off down the track, her form perfect, while Hayashi adjusted his stance before launching the javelin into the air.
The entire school was preparing.
And with sports day approaching fast, none of them could afford to slack off.

Chapter 90 – A Surprise in the Making
The days leading up to Sports Day were a blur of exhaustion, sweat, and intense competition. The entire school was alive with energy, the excitement practically radiating off the students as they practiced their respective events.
But amidst the chaos, a certain trio of girls was planning something far more interesting.
Ai, Nene, and Rika had secretly signed up for the cheerleading competition.
And they hadn’t told a single soul.

"Are you sure about this?" Nene whispered as the three of them huddled behind the gym.
Ai flipped through the pages of a notebook, filled with carefully drawn choreography. "Of course I’m sure. This is our chance."
Rika adjusted her ponytail, looking skeptical. "But why keep it a secret?"
Ai smirked. "Because the look on Shinchan’s face will be priceless."
Nene grinned. "And Kazama’s."
That was all the motivation Rika needed.
"Fine," she said, cracking her knuckles. "Let’s do this."

Their practice sessions were completely hidden from the rest of the group.
While everyone else was drenched in sweat running laps, lifting weights, or dodging flying javelins, Ai, Nene, and Rika were tucked away in the dance room, working on their routine.
"Five, six, seven, eight—!"
They moved in sync, steps sharp and precise, arms raised at just the right angles.
Cheerleading was no joke.
They had to memorize formations, perfect their jumps, and nail their timing—all without letting anyone catch on.
But they were determined.
Nene refused to let the boys steal the entire spotlight on Sports Day.
And Ai?
She was way too excited to see Shinchan’s reaction.
Because if there was one thing she knew about him—
It was that he never expected her to be the cheerleading type.
This was going to be fun.

Chapter 91 – The Burden of Leadership
It was another chaotic day in the student council office.
Papers were scattered across the desks, documents stacked so high that even Kazama looked close to breaking under the workload. Everyone was exhausted from the non-stop Sports Day preparations.
And then, the bomb dropped.
A teacher walked in, clearing his throat.
"As the student council president, Nohara-kun, you will be responsible for giving the opening speech on the day of the event."
Silence.
Kazama’s pen froze mid-signature. Ai nearly dropped her clipboard. Nene and Masao stared at each other. Even Bo, who was half-asleep in the corner, opened one eye.
All eyes turned to Shinchan.
He blinked. Then, casually, he leaned back in his chair, arms behind his head.
"Oh, that? No problem."
Kazama twitched. Ai twitched harder.
"You moron!" Kazama snapped, slamming his hands on the table. "This is a formal speech! You have to be serious! You need to prepare!"
Shinchan waved him off. "C’mon, it’s just a few words, right?"
Ai rubbed her temples. "Shinchan, if you go up there and say something stupid, the whole school will remember it forever."
He smirked. "Oh? So if I say something romantic, you’d remember it forever?"
Ai turned red. "That’s not what I meant!"
Masao, sweating bullets, raised a hand. "Uh… maybe we should help him write the speech?"
"Good idea," Kazama muttered, already pulling out his notebook. "Because I refuse to let this guy humiliate us all."
Shinchan stretched. "Fine, fine. But make it short. I don’t wanna be up there forever."
Kazama sighed, muttering under his breath. "Why is he the president again…?"

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 92 – The Speech That Shook the School
The entire school had gathered on the vast sports field, students lined up in their respective classes, teachers standing to the side, and banners waving in the warm breeze. Parents and guardians filled the stands, murmuring excitedly as they scanned the field for their children. The atmosphere was electric.
A long podium stood at the center of the stage, a microphone attached to it. Behind it sat the school principal, the faculty, and, of course, the student council representatives.
At the farthest corner of the stage, Shinchan sat, lazily swaying his legs, completely unfazed by the massive crowd before him.
Ai, sitting beside him, nudged him with her elbow. "You're about to go up there, at least pretend to be nervous!"
Shinchan yawned. "Relax, I got this."
Kazama, sitting on the other side, looked ready to have a heart attack. "You better read the speech exactly as we wrote it. No improvising. No jokes. No—"
But it was too late. The principal stepped forward, tapping the mic.
"Good morning, everyone! It is with great honor that we welcome you all to this year's Sports Festival! And to officially begin the event, we have our student council president, Nohara Shinnosuke!"
A thunderous applause echoed through the field.
Shinchan stood up, adjusted his school blazer, and walked toward the podium with a confidence that sent a shiver down Kazama’s spine. Ai clenched her fists, muttering, "Please don’t mess this up…"
Shinchan grabbed the mic.
He took a deep breath.
Then, with a grin, he leaned in and said—
"Yo! Everyone ready to have some fun?"
Silence.
Kazama's soul left his body. Ai buried her face in her hands.
Then—
The entire student body erupted in cheers.
"YEAHHHHHH!!!"
Shinchan smirked, letting the excitement settle before continuing. "Sports Day isn’t just about winning—"
Kazama sighed in relief. He’s actually saying the speech.
"—But let’s be real. Winning is the best part, so give it your all!"
More cheers.
"Run like your reputation depends on it! Jump like there’s free food at the finish line! And if you’re in the cheer squad, make sure you make every guy in school wish they joined too!"
A few gasps echoed from the faculty side. Ai kicked him from behind, hard.
"Ow! Fine, fine! What I mean is—have fun, give it your best, and don’t forget—" He pointed at the audience with a dramatic flair.
"Even if you lose, at least be entertaining about it!"
The school lost it.
Even some of the teachers couldn't help but chuckle. The principal coughed, unsure whether to scold him or clap.
And with that, Shinchan gave a lazy salute and walked back, grinning.
Ai stared at him, dumbfounded. "That… was the dumbest speech I’ve ever heard."
Kazama looked three seconds away from strangling him. "You’re insufferable."
Shinchan stretched. "And yet, the crowd loved it."
Indeed, as the sports festival officially began, students were still buzzing about their president's speech. Parents chuckled amongst themselves, saying, "That Nohara boy is something else."
And in the crowd, Hiroshi Nohara laughed proudly. "That’s my boy!"
Misae sighed. "That is your boy."
Himawari clapped excitedly, completely unbothered.
As the first events were called, Ai looked at Shinchan with a small smirk. "You do realize people are going to talk about that speech for years, right?"
He grinned back. "Good. Let them."

Chapter 93 – The Games Begin
The festival was officially underway. The energy in the air was electric, the crowd buzzing with anticipation as the first event was announced.
"First up! The Boys’ 100-Meter Sprint!"
A section of the field had been cleared, lanes marked with white chalk. The runners were already warming up, stretching and shaking off the nerves.
From the student council tent, Shinchan and the rest of the group watched. Ai, still somewhat annoyed with him from earlier, had her arms crossed but was focused on the field.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "The sprint’s an important event. It sets the momentum for the entire day."
"Y'know," Shinchan leaned back, "why do you sound like a sports commentator?"
"Because it matters! If our class wins, we get more points!"
"Oh noooo, how scaryyy."
"Stop acting like you don’t care!"
As they argued, Masao and Bo stood on the sidelines, watching the competitors get ready.
"Who do you think will win?" Bo asked.
Masao gulped. "Not us, that’s for sure."
Their class had a few decent runners, but none of them were elite-level fast.
"On your marks!"
The runners crouched down. The entire school quieted in anticipation.
"Get set!"
Shinchan sat up, suddenly paying attention.
Ai glanced at him, noticing. "You’re actually interested now?"
"...Maybe."
The air was thick with tension.
"GO!"
The runners exploded off the starting line, legs pumping, arms swinging. The crowd roared.
A blur of white and blue jerseys darted across the field.
"Oh! Number 4 is leading! But wait—Number 7 is catching up!"
Kazama was gripping his clipboard like his life depended on it. "Come on! Come on!"
Ai, still pretending to be mad, huffed but leaned forward anyway.
As the finish line came closer, two runners neck-and-neck pushed forward.
"It's going to be close!"
At the last second, one runner lunged forward, crossing the line just barely ahead of the other.
The whistle blew.
"Winner: Class 2-B!"
A massive cheer erupted from one side of the stands.
"Damn it!" Kazama groaned.
Shinchan patted his shoulder. "I mean, they ran. We watched. Who’s the real winner here?"
Kazama glared at him. "You’re competing later. I hope you trip."
Ai smirked. "I hope you get dead last."
Shinchan grinned. "You guys are so supportive."
As the runners cooled down, the next event was already being set up.
The day was far from over.
Continued in Chapter 94.
You said:
next 3 legged race.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 94 – A Tangle of Limbs
"Next up! The Three-Legged Race!"
Excitement rippled through the crowd as pairs lined up at the starting position, their legs bound together with thick, sturdy cloth. This event was a fan favorite—not because of the athleticism, but because of the guaranteed chaos and hilarious falls.
At the starting line stood Masao and Nene, their expressions comically different.
Masao looked like he was about to meet his end, sweating bullets, his knees slightly trembling.
Nene, on the other hand, had her hands on her hips, a confident smirk on her face. "Alright, listen up. Just follow my lead, and we’ll be fine."
"That’s easy for you to say!" Masao whined. "Why are we even doing this?"
"Because it was either this or the scavenger hunt, and I refuse to run around the entire school looking for nonsense like ‘a teacher’s favorite pen.’"
Masao gulped as he glanced at the other teams. Some were warming up, synchronized in their movements. Others were already struggling just standing in place.
"T-This feels like a bad idea..."
"Masao."
"Yes?"
Nene tightened the knot on their leg restraint, smacking him on the back. "If you drop me, I’ll kill you."
Masao turned pale. "W-Well, that’s encouraging!"
Meanwhile, on the sidelines, Shinchan and the rest of the group watched with unrestrained amusement.
"This is going to be hilarious." Shinchan grinned.
Ai smirked. "Masao might actually pass out."
"Honestly," Kazama sighed, adjusting his glasses, "I give them ten seconds before they fall."
Bo, ever the optimist, tilted his head. "I believe in them."
Shinchan patted Bo’s shoulder. "That makes one of us."
The announcer’s voice boomed over the speakers.
"Alright! Contestants, get ready!"
Nene and Masao braced themselves.
"Three!"
"Masao, move with me, not against me!"
"I-I’m trying!"
"Two!"
Shinchan whispered to Ai, "Should we place bets?"
"On Masao’s survival rate?"
"Exactly."
"One!"
Masao gulped.
"GO!"
Chaos.
Pairs lunged forward with varying degrees of success. Some immediately toppled over, others found a shaky rhythm. The lucky few actually ran smoothly.
Masao and Nene?
Masao panicked and moved too fast, forcing Nene to stumble.
"Masao, YOU IDIOT!"
"I’M SORRY, I’M SORRY!"
They managed to stay upright, but their movements were completely out of sync.
Meanwhile, the crowd was dying of laughter.
"Come on, Masao!" Shinchan howled.
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "I must say… they’re doing better than expected."
"That’s because Nene is basically dragging him." Ai pointed.
True enough, Nene had completely taken control, gripping Masao’s shirt and practically forcing him to match her rhythm.
"Faster, Masao!"
"I CAN’T FEEL MY LEG!"
Somehow, miraculously, they passed the halfway mark.
Other pairs had fallen behind or collapsed entirely, leaving three teams in the lead.
"Nene and Masao are actually keeping up!"
Bo smiled. "See? I told you!"
"I stand corrected," Kazama muttered.
With the finish line in sight, Nene took one last gamble—she launched forward.
"MASAO, NOW!"
"HUH?!"
Somehow, whether through instinct or sheer terror, Masao matched her movement.
The two lunged, barely crossing the finish line before another pair.
A loud whistle blew.
"AND SECOND PLACE GOES TO CLASS 2-A!"*
The crowd erupted.
Masao collapsed on the ground, wheezing. "I… I can’t feel my soul."
Nene wiped sweat from her forehead, hands on her hips. "We did it."
"Did we?" Masao groaned.
"Yes. And I carried us."
Masao whined, but even he couldn’t hide the small, proud smile forming on his lips.
Shinchan clapped. "Well, well. Guess you’re not completely useless, Masao."
Masao, still lying on the ground, weakly gave a thumbs-up. "Thank… you…?"
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "That was… actually impressive."
Ai grinned. "What a miracle. Masao finally won something."
"Barely," Nene corrected.
Masao groaned. "Just let me have this."
The event ended with cheers, and before they knew it, the next competition was being set up.
The day was far from over.
Continued in Chapter 95.
You said:
now it was a kendo match between shin and rika, though it was a mockup rehearsed match to cheer the crowds' adreline.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 95 – The Clash of Blades
"AND NOW, FOR A SPECIAL MATCH!"
The announcer’s voice boomed through the speakers, sending waves of excitement across the stadium. The audience, already hyped from the previous events, turned their attention to the kendo ring, where two figures stood facing each other—both in full kendo gear, shinai gripped tightly in their hands.
On one side was Shinchan, the mysterious prodigy who had shocked the school by returning to kendo. His dominant victory in the tournament still lingered in people’s minds, and now, they were about to witness him in action again.
On the other side stood Rika, the vice-captain of the kendo club. She was one of the strongest members, someone who had trained relentlessly to become a wall for others to surpass.
This wasn’t an official competition—it was a performance match, designed to pump up the crowd. But for anyone who knew either of them, it was obvious neither would go easy.
Kazama sighed from the sidelines. "This isn’t going to be a simple showcase, is it?"
Ai smirked. "Knowing those two? Not a chance."
The referee stepped forward, raising his hand. "This is a friendly match between the student council president, Nohara Shinnosuke, and the vice-captain of the kendo club, Rika Igarashi. Fighters, are you ready?"
Both raised their shinais in response.
"BEGIN!"
A shockwave of energy exploded between them.
Rika lunged first, her shinai cutting through the air in a precise, aggressive arc aimed at Shinchan’s head. But in a blink, he sidestepped, his movement so fluid it seemed effortless.
CLACK!
Her strike met nothing but empty air.
The crowd gasped.
"Fast!"
Rika gritted her teeth. "Not bad."
She wasted no time, adjusting her stance and delivering a rapid follow-up attack, her shinai slashing toward his wrist.
But again—CLACK!
Shinchan deflected it with ease.
Instead of counterattacking, he stood there, his stance unwavering, eyes peering at her from behind his mask.
The message was clear.
"Come at me."
Rika’s pride wouldn’t let her back down.
She tightened her grip and charged.
A rapid flurry of strikes followed, each one coming faster than the last, pushing Shinchan onto the defensive.
CLACK! CLACK! CLACK!
Blows rained down, but Shinchan’s defensive skill was on another level. He wasn’t just blocking—he was reading her movements, shifting his stance at the last possible moment, letting her attacks barely graze him before slipping away.
The audience was silent, entranced.
Even the teachers watching from the stands were leaning forward.
"He’s not just strong," one murmured. "He’s efficient. He barely moves more than he needs to."
"It’s like he’s playing with her," another whispered.
Rika felt it too.
"Damn it, he’s holding back."
That pissed her off.
"You think I can’t handle you going all out?" she snapped.
For the first time, Shinchan spoke.
"You sure?"
Before she could respond—
BAM!
A single step.
A single movement.
Shinchan lunged forward, his shinai cutting through the air like lightning.
Rika barely managed to react—CLACK!—blocking at the last moment, but the force sent her skidding back, her feet digging into the dirt.
The crowd erupted.
"HOLY—!"
"What was that speed?!"
Even the teachers stood up.
Ai, watching from the side, felt her heart skip a beat.
"That’s… unfair."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "So he really was holding back."*
Rika grinned, her hands trembling from the impact.
"Finally," she panted. "Now we're talking."
Shinchan smirked under his mask.
"Come on then."*
They clashed again, their shinais meeting in rapid succession, sending shockwaves through the air. This time, it was more intense. Rika stopped holding anything back, pouring all her strength into her strikes.
But Shinchan was still—
CLACK!
faster.
CLACK!
smarter.
CLACK!
better.
And then—
He vanished.
For a split second, Rika lost him in her vision.
And then she felt it.
The cold press of his shinai gently resting against her neck.
If this were a real match—she’d be dead.
Silence.
The entire stadium fell into an eerie stillness.
And then—
DEAFENING ROARS.
The crowd EXPLODED.
"WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!"
"I COULDN’T EVEN SEE HIM MOVE!"
"THAT WAS INSANE!"
Rika… started laughing.
"You bastard…" She took a deep breath and grinned. "That was fun."*
Shinchan tapped her on the shoulder with his shinai. "You weren’t bad either."*
The referee stepped in, raising his hand. "And that concludes the match!"
The applause was deafening, echoing through the entire stadium.
The match wasn’t real.
But the adrenaline it left behind?
That was very real.
As they walked off the field, Rika bumped her shoulder into his. "Next time, I’ll win for real."*
Shinchan smirked. "Good luck with that."*
From the sidelines, Ai crossed her arms. "He really loves showing off, huh?"
Kazama sighed. "At this point, are we even surprised anymore?"
The festival wasn’t over yet.
But already—Shinchan had left another legendary moment in its history.
And the day was far from done.
Continued in Chapter 96.
You said:
next was the long jump event of bo.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 96 – The Flight of Bo-chan
The energy from Shinchan and Rika’s explosive kendo match still lingered in the air, but the sports festival marched on.
Now, the focus shifted to the long jump event.
The crowd gathered near the track field, where a long sand pit stretched at the end of the runway. Students and parents alike leaned forward, waiting for the next event to unfold.
And at the center of it all—
Bo-chan.
Unlike the rowdy, nervous contestants beside him, he stood at the starting point, unmoved, his hands tucked inside his tracksuit pockets. His eyes, half-lidded as usual, gazed toward the sandpit with absolutely no urgency.
Ai tilted her head from the spectator stands. "Has Bo-chan… ever done long jump before?"
"I have no idea," Kazama admitted. "But for some reason, I’m a little scared."*
"Of what?"
"I don't know."*
Nene squinted. "It’s Bo-chan. There’s always something."*
Masao nodded in silent agreement.
The event officials lined up the contestants, each of them stepping forward for their attempts.
The first jumper—a third-year—ran forward at full speed and launched himself from the takeoff board.
"2.8 meters!"
The crowd cheered. It was a decent start.
The second contestant—a track club member—followed, his form more disciplined, landing at 3.4 meters.
One by one, the participants took their turn, each jump adding to the growing excitement.
Then, the announcer spoke.
"Next, we have… Bo Suzuki!"
All eyes turned to Bo-chan.
Silence.
He stood there, motionless.
"…Bo-chan?" the announcer called again.
Without a word, Bo-chan slowly took off his jacket, revealing his simple sportswear underneath. He handed the jacket to Shinchan, who took it without question.
Then—Bo-chan walked to the starting line.
Not ran.
Not jogged.
Walked.
The crowd murmured.
"Is he… taking this seriously?"
"Is he nervous?"
"I don’t think he even knows what’s going on."*
Ai sighed. "Maybe long jump isn’t his thing."*
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Maybe he’s just here to participate…"
And then—
Bo-chan moved.
It wasn’t a sprint. It wasn’t even a run.
It was a… calculated jog.
His legs, though moving at a slow and steady pace, had purpose. His posture was relaxed, as if he wasn’t exerting himself at all.
Yet—
Something felt off.
"Why does this look so ominous?" Masao whispered.
At the last possible second—
Bo-chan launched himself from the board.
The moment his foot left the ground—
The crowd held their breath.
It was… graceful.
There was no struggle. No flailing arms.
Just pure, controlled motion.
Bo-chan glided.
He didn’t just jump—he ascended.
For a brief, bizarre moment—
It looked like he was… flying.
And then—
THUD.
A perfect landing into the sandpit.
Silence.
Then, the judge raised his measuring tape.
"4.8 meters!"
The entire stadium—
EXPLODED.
"WHAT?!"
"THAT’S THE LONGEST JUMP YET!"*
"WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!"
Even the event officials were stunned.
Bo-chan simply stood up, dusted the sand off his pants, and walked back like nothing happened.
Shinchan handed him his jacket back. "You had that in you the whole time?"
Bo-chan nodded. "Mmm."*
Ai gawked. "Then why do you move so slow all the time?!"
Bo-chan blinked. "No reason."*
Masao collapsed onto the bench. "I’m gonna lose my mind."*
Kazama adjusted his glasses—again. "…That was horrifying."*
The crowd was still in disbelief as Bo-chan sat down quietly, back to his usual motionless state.
But one thing was clear—
Even gravity itself seemed to have a hard time figuring out how Bo-chan worked.
And the festival continued.
Up next… the Archery Event.
You said:
continue. shin cheered on ai, embarassingly loud.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 97 – The Archer and Her Noisy President
After the chaotic brilliance of Bo-chan’s long jump, the festival moved swiftly to its next spectacle—
The Archery Event.
The air buzzed with excitement as the participants lined up, bows in hand, preparing for their shots. The competition was being held on the field, where targets stood at a measured distance.
Among the competitors—
Ai Suotome.
She stood tall, dressed in the traditional kyūdō uniform—a crisp white keikogi and a deep blue hakama, with a matching archery glove snugly fitted on her right hand.
Her expression was calm, focused—the epitome of grace and elegance.
But the moment Shinchan saw her stepping forward—
He forgot all sense of dignity.
"AI-CHAAAN!!"
His voice roared across the entire field.
The crowd turned their heads in his direction.
Kazama, Masao, Nene, Bo-chan, and even Rika, Minami, and Hayashi—all stared at him in disbelief.
Ai’s perfect composure shattered instantly.
Her entire body jerked, and she nearly fumbled with her bow.
"SHINCHAN?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" she hissed, her face burning red.
But it was too late.
Shinchan had already leaned over the fence, cupping his hands around his mouth like a sports dad at a peewee soccer match.
"YOU GOT THIS, AI-CHAN! SHOW ‘EM WHO’S BOSS!"
The entire stadium burst into laughter.
Ai covered her face in shame. "Oh my god…"
Nene giggled. "Weren’t you just mad at him a few days ago?"
"Not now!" Ai whisper-yelled, trying to regain her composure.
Meanwhile, Kazama rubbed his temples. "Shin-chan, can you at least—"
"AI-CHAN, YOU LOOK SO COOOOL!!" Shinchan interrupted, his voice booming.
A teacher coughed awkwardly. The referee even paused to glance at him before sighing and gesturing for Ai to continue the match.
Ai took a deep breath, trying to block out the moron she loved.
She pulled back the string.
Her heartbeat slowed.
Everything else—Shinchan’s shouting, the laughter, the festival noise—faded away.
The moment the string reached her cheek—
She released.
TWANG.
The arrow cut through the air—
—And struck the target dead center.
The crowd erupted in cheers.
Shinchan?
"THAT’S MY AI-CHAN!!!"
More laughter.
Ai lowered her bow, her face still red, but there was an undeniable smile tugging at her lips.
Maybe, she thought, just maybe, having the dumbest, loudest, most embarrassing supporter wasn’t the worst thing in the world.
And the sports festival continued.
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 98 – The Relay: The President’s Rivalry and a Sister’s Cheer
The entire field was buzzing with excitement.
The second-last event of the day—the relay race—was about to begin.
This wasn’t just any relay.
The fastest runners from each year had been selected to compete, making this one of the most anticipated races of the festival.
And among the runners—
Team A:
Minami (Former Student Council President – Known for his endurance but not necessarily speed.)


Hayashi (The Track Club Ace – A sprinter with explosive speed.)


Kazama (The Current Vice President – Smart, calculating, and competitive as hell.)


Shinchan (The Infamous President – Wild card. No one really knew his full potential in a serious race.)


Team B:
Rika (Kendo Club’s Vice Captain – Not a sprinter but athletic and agile.)


Akari (Former Vice President – Surprisingly quick despite her student council background.)


Masao (…He was there. He had a big heart. That counted, right?)


Bo-chan (The Unexpected Dark Horse – No one knew if he was fast or not… But his long jump earlier suggested he might be a sleeper threat.)


The entire school gathered around the track, eager to see this match-up.
Shinchan was stretching, cracking his neck, when a voice boomed from the crowd—
"SHIN-CHAAAN!!"
His head snapped up.
Ai stood on the sidelines, cupping her hands around her mouth.
"DO YOUR BEST! I BELIEVE IN YOU!!"
The crowd turned to her.
Shinchan froze.
The next second, a smug smirk curled on his lips.
He casually lifted a hand and waved lazily. "Yeah, yeah. Watch me win, Ai-chan."
Ai pouted. "At least pretend to be embarrassed!"
Meanwhile—
Kazama was adjusting his shoes, mentally preparing for his part of the relay.
Then he heard it.
"KAZAMAAA!!!"
His whole body locked up.
He turned his head slowly, eyes wide in horror.
On the other side of the field, standing on the bleachers, was none other than—
Himawari.
His heart dropped into his stomach.
The worst part?
She wasn’t just cheering normally.
She had both hands cupped around her mouth, standing on her tiptoes, her voice ringing out across the stadium.
"YOU BETTER WIN, KAZAMA-SENPAI!!!"
The entire student body whipped their heads toward Kazama.
Shinchan—who had just finished grinning at Ai—snapped his head toward Kazama like a predator who just heard its rival step into its territory.
His sharp, murderous glare bored into Kazama’s soul.
Kazama gulped. Oh no.
He wanted to say something, but before he could—
The whistle blew.
The relay had begun.
The Race Begins
Minami and Rika took the first lap.
Minami, despite his lack of speed, was shockingly good at maintaining pace. He wasn’t the fastest, but he had years of endurance training from his council days—balancing late-night work, running across school, and organizing events like these.
Rika, however, was an athlete. She pushed hard, trying to keep up, but the gap was small.
Akari and Hayashi took the next lap.
And this was where Team A blasted ahead.
Hayashi was a track star. He launched forward, his feet kicking up dust, effortlessly overtaking Akari before she even reached full speed.
The crowd roared.
By the time he reached the baton exchange, Kazama had a solid lead.
Masao tried his absolute best for Team B—truly, he did—but the gap was widening.
Kazama vs. Bo-chan
As Kazama grabbed the baton, he shot off like a bullet.
He was fast, calculated, efficient.
Then—
Bo-chan started running.
And no one expected what happened next.
This was the first time anyone had seen Bo-chan in full sprint mode.
The moment he started—
The ground rumbled slightly.
The air shifted.
Bo-chan, despite his seemingly slow nature, was absurdly fast.
"W-WHAT THE—?!" Kazama stumbled for a second.
Bo-chan’s long strides allowed him to cover massive ground in just a few steps.
The audience erupted in screams.
HE WAS GAINING.
For the first time in his life, Kazama felt like he was being chased by a horror movie monster.
The baton exchange was closing in.
Kazama dug deep, pushing his body to the absolute limit to maintain the lead—
And then, just as he was about to pass the baton to Shinchan—
Shinchan’s Death Glare
He felt it.
That chilling, murderous pressure.
Kazama’s hand trembled as he extended the baton.
Shinchan stood there, arms crossed, his gaze burning into Kazama’s soul.
"…Senpai, huh?"
Kazama’s body froze.
His brain short-circuited.
"I—IT’S NOT WHAT YOU THINK—!"
SNATCH.
Shinchan grabbed the baton and took off.
The Final Sprint – Shin vs. ???
With the final lap underway, Shinchan was in the lead.
His strides were powerful, calculated but fluid, every step pushing him closer to victory.
The crowd screamed.
The only question—
Could Team B’s final runner catch up?
And then—
A figure from Team B exploded forward.
Shinchan glanced back and—
His eyes widened.
It was Hayashi’s younger brother, a first-year track prodigy.
And he was fast.
The gap closed rapidly.
For the first time in the race—
Shinchan felt an actual challenge.
The finish line was approaching.
Two runners. One goal.
The stadium held its breath.
Who would win?
—TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 99.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 99 – The Final Sprint
The entire stadium was on its feet.
The relay’s final stretch was happening in real-time, and the tension was palpable.
Shinchan was in the lead—but barely.
His opponent, Hayashi’s younger brother Ren, was closing in fast.
Shinchan could hear the rapid footsteps behind him, could feel the air shifting with the sheer force of speed.
And in that moment, a single thought ran through his head—
"Damn, this kid is fast."
He grit his teeth.
No way was he losing here.
The finish line was just ahead.
The roar of the crowd faded into the background as Shinchan pushed forward, every fiber of his being focusing on one thing—
Winning.
Ren lunged forward—closing the distance—
But in the final split second—
Shinchan dove forward, crossing the finish line first.
A sharp beep rang from the digital timer.
And just like that—
It was over.
A moment of silence followed.
Then—
The stadium erupted.
"HE WON!!"
"THAT WAS CRAZY!"
"DID YOU SEE THAT DIVE?!"
Shinchan lay on the ground for a second, panting, before turning his head and grinning up at Ren.
"Close one, kid."
Ren huffed, still catching his breath, before breaking into a grin.
"Tch. Next time, I’ll get you."
Shinchan smirked. "Looking forward to it."
Then suddenly—
"SHINCHAAAAN!!"
Before he could react—
Ai tackled him.
She launched onto him, nearly knocking the air out of his lungs as she gripped his shoulders.
"You idiot! That was dangerous! What if you got hurt?! I swear—"
Shinchan just blinked at her, his signature grin never leaving his face.
"Oh? I thought you were mad at me?"
Ai froze.
For a moment, she remembered that she was supposed to be ignoring him.
But seeing him run like that… Seeing him win…
All of it went out the window.
Instead, she just pouted aggressively.
"I am mad at you."
Then she turned her head away dramatically and added, "But… good job or whatever."
Shinchan chuckled.
Then, from the sidelines—
"SHIN! KAZAMA!"
Their group was rushing towards them.
Hima came straight for Kazama, her eyes shining.
"Kazama-senpai!! That was amazing!! I knew you were fast, but I didn’t expect that!"
Kazama—who had just barely recovered from Shinchan’s earlier glare—felt his soul leave his body at the words "Kazama-senpai" again.
He stiffened.
From behind him, Shinchan cracked his knuckles.
"Kazama-senpai, huh?"
Kazama turned to him with fear in his eyes.
"It’s really not what you think!!"
Meanwhile—
Masao and Nene were still panting from their three-legged race earlier, but they were just as excited.
"You guys were awesome!" Nene grinned.
"Yeah!" Masao added. "I really thought Ren might actually win at the end there!"
Bo-chan just nodded sagely. "Good race."
Minami crossed his arms, smirking. "You sure you don’t want to quit the council and join the track team, Shin?"
Shinchan waved him off. "Nah, I don’t need another club to run. The kendo club is enough."
Rika, standing beside him, smirked. "If you actually showed up for kendo more, that’d be nice."
Before he could respond—
The announcer’s voice echoed over the field.
"And that concludes our relay event! The final event—the Cheerleading Performance—will begin shortly!"
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "Cheerleading, huh?"
That’s when he noticed something odd.
Ai, Nene, and Rika were avoiding eye contact.
He narrowed his eyes.
"…Wait a second."
Ai suddenly started whistling suspiciously.
Nene looked at the sky like it was the most interesting thing in the world.
Rika adjusted her sleeves like she was about to enter battle.
Shinchan’s eyes widened.
"You guys—"
"You’ll see, President." Ai winked.
Then, before he could press for answers—
They were gone.
Shinchan just stood there, blinking.
Then, he turned to Kazama.
Kazama sighed. "They’re up to something, aren’t they?"
Shinchan smirked.
"Oh yeah. And I can’t wait to find out what it is."
To Be Continued in Chapter 100.

Chapter 100 – The Final Showdown
The atmosphere in the stadium was electric.
All eyes were locked onto the field as the final event—the Cheerleading Competition—was about to begin.
Unlike the other sports events, where multiple teams competed, this was a one-on-one showdown.
Two teams. Ten members each.
One of them, Team A, had a certain trio—Ai, Nene, and Rika.
And no one had known about it until just now.
Shinchan stared at the stage, completely caught off guard.
"Wait… what??"
Beside him, Kazama adjusted his glasses, equally baffled.
"They signed up for this??"
Masao looked just as shocked. "Since when do they even do cheerleading?!"
Bo-chan, ever the wise observer, simply muttered, "Deception."
Shinchan shook his head, still trying to process the situation.
Then—
The music started.
And what followed next…
Was pure madness.

THE PERFORMANCE
The moment the beat dropped—
The crowd went wild.
Ai flipped into position, landing with a perfectly executed spin.
Rika and Nene followed seamlessly, their movements sharp and precise.
The rest of their team moved in sync, their routine clearly well-rehearsed.
But the real show began when Ai, Nene, and Rika stepped forward.
They weren’t just doing regular cheer moves.
Oh no.
They were dancing.
And they were good.
Really, really good.
Shinchan felt his brain short-circuiting.
Kazama’s glasses nearly slipped off his nose.
Masao turned red, unsure of where to look.
Bo-chan simply nodded. "Interesting."
The routine was a mix of modern dance and acrobatics, and with each move, the crowd got louder.
But what truly broke Shinchan’s mind—
Was Ai-chan’s part.
She stepped forward, her body moving fluidly, completely in her element.
And then—
She locked eyes with him.
And smirked.
Shinchan’s soul left his body.
Kazama turned to look at him, adjusting his glasses.
"…You good?"
Shinchan didn’t even blink.
His entire existence was malfunctioning.
What… What the hell was this??
Since when did Ai-chan move like that?!

THE FINAL MOMENT
The performance was reaching its climax.
Rika executed a perfect backflip, landing effortlessly.
Nene and Ai did a synchronized spin, their movements flawless.
And for the final move—
Ai was lifted into the air, held up by her teammates as she struck a final pose.
The crowd erupted.
The whistle blew.
And just like that—
It was over.
The stadium was left in a stunned silence before—
Deafening applause.

THE AFTERMATH
Shinchan was still processing reality.
Ai, Nene, and Rika came running toward the group, beaming.
"So?" Ai placed her hands on her hips, grinning smugly. "Surprised?"
Shinchan just stared at her.
Ai’s grin widened.
"You should be."
Kazama sighed, shaking his head. "I have so many questions."
Masao, still bright red, could only mutter, "I… uh… I need a drink."
Bo-chan gave a simple nod. "Well played."
And Shinchan?
He finally found his voice.
"You… you planned this."
Ai winked. "Obviously."
Shinchan exhaled.
Then—
He smirked.
"Fine. You win this round."
Ai beamed.
The final event had ended.
The sports festival was over.
But somehow, Shinchan had a feeling…
This battle was just beginning.

Chapter 101 – Just Another Day (Or So They Thought)
The sports festival had ended, the cheers had faded, and life at school returned to its usual chaotic normalcy.
For once, there were no major events, no big competitions, no dramatic revelations—just a normal day.
Or, at least, that was the expectation.

MORNING – CLASSROOM ANTICS
The first class had barely started when Kazama sighed heavily, rubbing his temples.
"Shinchan… we have exams coming up. Shouldn’t you, I don’t know, study?"
Shinchan, who was currently balancing a pencil on his nose, blinked lazily.
"Kazama… buddy… we just survived a sports festival. My brain needs a vacation."
Kazama groaned. "It’s literally just math class. This isn’t a vacation, it’s basic education!"
From behind them, Masao peeked up from his book. "I think Shinchan has a point…"
Kazama shot him a look. "You think?"
Bo-chan, ever the wise one, muttered, "Existence is suffering."
Shinchan nodded sagely. "See? Even Bo-chan gets it."
Kazama was about to lose his mind.
Meanwhile, Nene, sitting a few seats away, clicked her tongue in annoyance.
"Ugh. Can you guys stop goofing off? I’m actually trying to learn here!"
Shinchan grinned. "Nene, we all know you’re just waiting for lunch so you can get free snacks from Masao."
Masao immediately turned red.
"I-I—That’s not—!"
Before he could finish, the teacher slammed the chalk against the board.
"Enough talking! Focus on the lesson!"
Everyone straightened up, though Shinchan still didn’t bother taking notes.
Ai-chan, sitting diagonally across from him, smirked.
"Hey, Shin," she whispered. "Are you failing math?"
Shinchan tilted his head, deep in thought. "Hmm… depends. What’s failing?"
Ai rolled her eyes. "Unbelievable."

LUNCH BREAK – COUNCIL SHENANIGANS
As expected, the student council office was the coolest (temperature-wise) place in school.
Which meant it was completely full.
Minami (the previous president) was lounging on the couch like she still owned the place.
Hayashi (Shinchan’s old kendo rival) had somehow claimed a chair despite not being in the council.
Rika (vice-captain of the kendo club) was leaning against the desk, casually eating her lunch.
Meanwhile, Ai and Kazama were actually trying to do work, while Shinchan… was just existing.
"Okay," Ai sighed, flipping through some documents. "So we have two upcoming meetings—one for the cultural festival and one for general school improvements."
Kazama nodded. "We also need to approve the new club budget."
Shinchan yawned dramatically.
"Let me guess," Ai said, looking at him. "You don’t care."
Shinchan grinned. "Bingo."
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. "You’re the student council president. This is literally your job."
"Exactly." Shinchan leaned back. "That’s why I’m delegating."
Kazama looked two seconds away from throwing something.
Meanwhile, Minami chuckled from the couch. "You guys are fun to watch. Makes me miss my old council days."
Ai groaned. "You’re still here, Minami! You never actually left!"
Minami winked. "And yet, no one kicks me out. Funny, isn’t it?"

AFTER SCHOOL – CLUB ACTIVITIES
Shinchan had two stops to make after school.
First—the kendo club.
Despite the festival being over, Shinchan still showed up to practice.
"Yo, Hayashi," Shinchan called out, grabbing a shinai. "You still salty about the match?"
Hayashi scoffed. "Salty? Please. I’m just waiting for a rematch."
Rika, tying her hair back, grinned. "You two are such meatheads. Just admit you’re friends already."
Hayashi scowled. "Never."
Shinchan just smirked. "That’s exactly what a friend would say."
After a few sparring rounds, Shinchan left the clubroom, still feeling high on adrenaline.
And then—
Ai was waiting for him.
"Oi," she said, arms crossed. "You still coming to the council meeting later?"
Shinchan stretched, yawning. "Ehh, do I have to?"
Ai narrowed her eyes.
"You do if you don’t want me sending all of your paperwork to Kazama."
Shinchan froze.
"…You wouldn’t."
Ai smirked. "Try me."
Shinchan sighed dramatically. "Fine, fine. Let’s go, Vice Prez."
Ai rolled her eyes, but she was smiling.

EVENING – WALKING HOME
By the time they left school, the sky was already turning a warm orange, signaling the end of another day.
Shinchan walked alongside Kazama, Ai, Masao, Nene, and Bo-chan, the usual group.
Ai stretched. "That was a long day."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "It wouldn’t have been if someone actually helped with paperwork."
Shinchan pretended not to hear that.
Masao, munching on a snack, asked, "Hey, are we hanging out this weekend?"
Nene frowned. "We literally see each other every day. Why would we hang out again?"
Bo-chan, deep in thought, simply said, "Because we are friends."
Silence.
Then, everyone burst out laughing.
As they walked home together, under the setting sun, Shinchan thought—
Yeah.
Life was pretty good.
Even if every day came with nonsense.
To Be Continued.
You said:
the weekend came and ai came to shin home, saying she has to stay here, for what, she makes up and excuse.

Chapter 102 – The Uninvited (But Not Unwelcome) Guest
It was a lazy Saturday morning, the kind where the sun filtered through the windows just right, and the world seemed to move a little slower.
Shinchan had no plans—just how he liked it.
That was, until—
DING DONG.
The doorbell rang.
Shinchan, still in his pajamas, blinked at the sound.
“Who the hell—?”
Grumbling, he dragged himself to the front door and swung it open, only to find—
Ai-chan. Standing there. With a suitcase.
"...Oi." Shinchan squinted. "Are you lost?"
Ai huffed. "Of course not." She brushed past him into the house, her suitcase rolling behind her like she owned the place.
Shinchan blinked. Then slowly closed the door.
"...Should I be concerned?"
Ai turned, flashing him an innocent smile that was anything but innocent.
"I'm staying here for the weekend."
Shinchan stared.
"...Since when?"
"Since now."
"...Why?"
Ai crossed her arms. "I have my reasons."
"Which are?"
"...A very serious situation."
Shinchan raised an eyebrow.
"You’re making this up, aren’t you?"
Ai gasped dramatically. "How could you accuse me of such a thing?"
"Because you're you."
Ai pouted. "Fine. If you must know—my house is being… um… cleaned. Deep cleaned. Very dangerous. Can’t be there."
Shinchan narrowed his eyes. "And you couldn’t go to a hotel? Or, I don’t know, your family’s other places?"
Ai hesitated for half a second.
Shinchan smirked. "Yeah, thought so."
"...Shut up. I’m already here, so deal with it."
Shinchan sighed deeply.
"Does Misae-nee even know about this?"
"She will when I tell her."
At that exact moment, Misae's voice called from the kitchen.
"Shin-chan, who was at the door?"
Shinchan turned his head, just as Ai grabbed his arm and whispered.
"Say I was invited."
Shinchan stared at her.
Then turned toward the kitchen.
"MOM, AI-CHAN'S HERE UNINVITED!"
"Oi!!"
From the kitchen, Misae replied, "Oh, that’s nice! Ai-chan, you’re always welcome! Do you want snacks?"
Ai grinned triumphantly. "See? She doesn’t mind."
Shinchan muttered, "That’s because she doesn’t know you’re plotting something."
Ai patted his shoulder. "Don’t think too hard. It’s bad for you."

THE PROBLEM OF LIVING TOGETHER
With Ai officially intruding on his weekend, Shinchan was forced to deal with a new reality:
Ai. In his house.
All the time.
She had taken over the sofa, the TV remote, and somehow, his favorite spot in the living room.
And now—
"Why are you in my room?" Shinchan asked flatly, standing in his doorway.
Ai, lounging on his bed, didn’t even look up from her phone.
"It’s more comfortable here."
"...Then go sleep in the guest room."
Ai stretched. "But your room has… you know… personality."
Shinchan squinted. "That’s a fancy way of saying ‘messy.’"
Ai smirked. "You said it, not me."
Shinchan sighed, rubbing his temples. "Okay, ground rules."
Ai rolled onto her stomach, propping her chin on her hands. "I’m listening."
"One—you stay out of my room."
"Denied."
"...Two—you don’t mess with my stuff."
"Also denied."
"Three—"
"Shin, these rules suck."
Shinchan groaned. "You suck."
Ai beamed. "And yet, you let me stay."
Shinchan was seriously regretting his life choices.

DINNER TIME – FAMILY CHAOS
When Himawari got home from her own plans, she took one look at Ai’s suitcase in the hallway and grinned.
“Ohhh? Ai-neechan’s staying over?”
Ai smiled sweetly. "That’s right, Hima-chan!"
Himawari turned to her brother, smirking.
"...What did you do to her, Nii-chan?"
Shinchan deadpanned. "Oi. Why is it my fault?"
"Because no girl just randomly stays at a guy’s house unless she has a reason~"
Ai laughed while Shinchan just groaned.
"Mom," he called toward the kitchen, "can you tell Hima to stop reading too much into things?"
Misae, setting dinner on the table, just smiled.
"Oh, I don’t know. She might have a point."
Shinchan stared.
"...Mom. Not you too."
Misae patted his shoulder. "I’m just saying, I wouldn’t mind more grandkids in the future."
Shinchan choked.
Ai, laughing, poured herself some tea like nothing happened.
"Great food, as always, Misae-san!"
Himawari grinned. "You’re practically family, Ai-neechan!"
Shinchan just buried his face in his hands.

NIGHTTIME – FINAL STRAW
By the time it was late, Shinchan had officially given up.
Ai was still hanging out in his room, despite having her own.
She sat cross-legged on the floor, eating snacks, while Shinchan leaned against the bed, flipping through a manga.
After a moment of silence, Ai spoke.
"...Hey, Shin."
Shinchan looked up. "Hm?"
Ai smiled, but this time, it was softer.
"Thanks for letting me stay."
Shinchan blinked.
For a second, he almost asked if something was wrong.
But instead—
He shrugged. "It’s whatever. Not like I had a choice."
Ai rolled her eyes. "Just take the compliment, idiot."
Shinchan smirked. "Fine. You’re welcome, oh mighty freeloader."
Ai threw a pillow at him.
Shinchan laughed.
And somehow—
The weekend didn’t seem so bad after all.

Chapter 103 – The Line Between Joking and… Something Else?
It was almost midnight, and Shinchan was ready to sleep.
At least, he thought he was.
Because just as he was getting comfortable, lying on his bed, eyes closed—
Something moved.
He opened his eyes.
And there, on his bed, next to him, grinning like an idiot—
Ai-chan.
"Yo."
Shinchan blinked.
"...Oi."
Ai stretched her arms above her head, completely unfazed.
"Comfy bed. Good job, Shin."
Shinchan just stared.
"Why," he asked, very slowly, "are you in my bed?"
Ai smirked.
"Because you didn’t say I couldn’t."
Shinchan took a deep breath.
"Get. Out."
Ai rolled onto her side, resting her head on her hand.
"Aw, c’mon. You let me use your TV, your room, your manga, your bathroom—why stop now?"
Shinchan pinched the bridge of his nose.
"This is not the same thing."
Ai gasped dramatically. "Oh my God, are you nervous?"
Shinchan scoffed. "Of course not."
"Then what’s the problem?"
"Because you’re you!"
"And?"
"And I don’t trust you!"
Ai cackled.
"I should be the one saying that, idiot!"
Shinchan groaned, dragging a hand down his face.
"This is so dumb. Just go to your own room."
Ai pouted.
"But I like this one."
"...Why?"
She tapped her chin.
"Hmm… I dunno."
Then, smirking—
"Maybe ‘cause it smells like you."
Shinchan choked on air.
"Oi. What the hell does that even mean?!"
Ai grinned. "Figure it out, genius~"
Shinchan was about two seconds away from throwing her off the bed.
Instead, he narrowed his eyes.
"...Are you doing this just to mess with me?"
Ai blinked.
"...Obviously."
Shinchan clicked his tongue.
"Knew it."
Ai snickered but didn’t move.
She pulled the blanket over herself, yawned, and—
"Alright, goodnight."
Shinchan gawked.
"Oi, don’t just say goodnight like you live here!"
Ai was already getting comfortable.
"Too late. Night, Shin."
"...Tch."
Shinchan stared at the ceiling.
This was… fine.
Everything was fine.
He was not letting this get to him.
Nope.
Not at all.
Not even a little.
…
……
………
"Stop stealing the blanket."
"Get your own."
"It’s my bed!"
"Exactly. Sharing is caring."
Shinchan sighed.
This girl.
He turned away, muttering.
"...You’re lucky I’m too tired to kick you out."
Behind him, Ai smirked to herself.
"Sure, Shin. Sure."
And just like that—
They fell asleep.

Chapter 104 – The Great Sunday Roast
Sunday morning.
The birds were chirping. The sun was shining. A peaceful, normal morning.
Except—
"HIIIIIMAAAAAA!!"
A scream erupted from Shinchan’s room.
It was Ai’s scream.
"GOOD MORNING, BIG BROTHER!"
That was Hima.
And Shinchan?
Still half-asleep, tangled in his blanket—
And fully confused.
He blinked, staring at Hima, who was standing beside his bed—
With the biggest grin on her face.
"...Oi."
"I KNEW IT!" Hima pointed dramatically. "You DO have a girlfriend!"
Ai, still waking up, looked around, then—
"...Oh."
She saw the problem.
She was still in Shinchan’s bed.
With Shinchan.
And now, Hima had witnessed it.
Ai blinked.
Then she slowly grinned.
"Oh my," she gasped, dramatically clutching her chest. "Shin-chan, what will people say?!"
Shinchan gritted his teeth.
"SHUT UP."
"SCANDALOUS~"
"GET OUT OF MY ROOM."
But before Hima could run out and spread the news to the world—
"Oi, what’s with the noise—"
The door swung open.
And there stood—
Misae and Hiroshi.
Silence.
Shinchan and Ai were still in bed.
Hima was standing there like she had won the lottery.
And their parents?
Misae’s eyes narrowed.
Hiroshi’s jaw dropped.
And then—
"Oh. My. God."
Hiroshi grinned.
"My boy’s grown up."
Shinchan froze.
"OI, DON’T MAKE IT WEIRD!"
Misae cracked her knuckles.
"So, Ai-chan~?"
Ai tilted her head, smiling sweetly.
"Yes, Misae-san?"
Misae leaned in.
"When’s the wedding?"
Ai burst out laughing.
Shinchan felt his soul leave his body.
"I’M GONNA DIE."
And from that moment on—
They never stopped talking about it.
For the entire day.
For all of Sunday.
During breakfast.
During lunch.
Even when Shinchan tried to escape the house—
"Oi, Shin-chan," Hiroshi called. "If you're heading out, take Ai-chan! Might as well go on a date!"
Misae nodded. "Oh, and buy some wedding magazines while you're out!"
Hima clapped. "I get to be the flower girl!"
Shinchan: "I’M MOVING OUT."
And Ai?
She was having the time of her life.
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 105 – The Night of No Escape
Nighttime.
After a full day of relentless teasing, Shinchan thought—
Finally. Peace.
But he should have known.
He should have known.
Because as soon as he got into bed—
"Oi, move over."
Ai stood by his bedside, arms crossed, looking far too comfortable with this situation.
Behind her, Hima grinned.
"Mom said you both HAVE to sleep together again."
Shinchan twitched.
"...What kind of stupid rule is that?"
"Not a rule, just something Mom and Dad decided~" Hima sang.
Ai smirked.
"You heard them, Shin-chan. Make room."
Shinchan sighed, defeated.
"...I hate this family."
And so—
For the second night in a row—
They slept in the same bed.

The problem?
This time, Ai was facing him.
Very close.
And Shinchan—
He noticed things.
Like how Ai’s hair smelled weirdly nice.
Or how her face was way too close.
Or how his heart was beating too fast.
…Oi. What the hell is this?
He gulped, looking away.
Ignore it. Just sleep.
But then—
As he shifted, his hand accidentally moved—
And brushed against Ai’s waist.
Through her thin pajama shirt.
…Soft.
Shinchan froze.
Ai froze.
Silence.
Shinchan snapped his hand away.
"...Oi."
Ai stared at him.
"...Shin-chan."
"...That wasn’t on purpose."
"...I didn’t say anything."
Silence again.
Ai slowly turned around.
"Good night."
"Yeah. Shut up."
But their faces?
Burning red.
And neither of them got much sleep that night.
You said:
next day when they left for school from the same house, a few student saw them and by the time they reached school the entire school talked how the president was dating the scretary of the council. and there was also their friend grp, now grown more than just kazama, nene, masao and bo.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 106 – The Rumor That Shook the School
It all started with a few students.
Just a couple of random early-morning schoolgoers who happened to be near the Nohara household when two people walked out together.
A boy and a girl.
Wearing the same school uniform.
From the same house.
At the same time.
And one of them just so happened to be the student council president.
"Oi… isn’t that Nohara?"
"Wait… and isn’t that Aihara-san?!"
And just like that—
The rumors began.
By the time Shinchan and Ai made it to school, the halls were buzzing.
"Oi, you heard? The president is dating the secretary!"
"They came to school together! From the same house!"
"You serious?!! I KNEW there was something between them!"
"Wait, wait, this is Shinchan we’re talking about. Maybe he just passed out at her house like an idiot?"
"THAT MAKES IT WORSE!"
Shinchan and Ai stood at the entrance gate, looking around.
"...Why is everyone staring at us?" Ai asked.
Shinchan blinked. "...Did I forget to zip up my pants?"
Ai facepalmed. "NO, YOU IDIOT."
Before they could figure it out—
The friend group arrived.
And it was no longer just Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Bo.
No, the group had expanded.
There was now Rika, Minami, Hayashi, and Akari.
And every single one of them stormed towards them.

Kazama: "Explain. Now."
Nene: "Did you two really…"
Masao: "WAIT, DID YOU—"
Bo: (silent thumbs up.)
Rika: "I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME!"
Minami: "Tch. So the president and vice president pattern skips a generation, huh?"
Hayashi: "I feel betrayed. I wanted to witness the confession LIVE."
Akari: "Is there a wedding date yet?"
Shinchan and Ai just… stared.
"...I don’t know what’s happening," Shinchan admitted.
"Me neither," Ai muttered.
But one thing was clear—
Today was going to be chaos.
You said:
they realise what all the noise in the school was all about and get embarassed about it and realise their mistake, especially ai. and they cant even say that abseloutly nothing happened as something did happen.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 107 – The Aftermath of a Scandal That Wasn’t
By the time they reached the student council office, Shinchan and Ai finally pieced together what the entire school was freaking out about.
It hit Ai first.
And then she froze.
"Oh. My. God."
Shinchan slowly turned to her.
"...You just realized, didn’t you?"
She grabbed her own head, looking mortified.
"We came to school together."
Shinchan nodded.
"From your house."
Shinchan nodded again.
"After spending the night."
Shinchan nodded.
"AFTER BEING FORCED TO SLEEP TOGETHER."
Shinchan paused, then slowly nodded.
Ai turned absolutely red.
And then, finally—
She realized the worst part.
She couldn’t even say "NOTHING HAPPENED"
Because SOMETHING DID HAPPEN.
She thought back to last night.
Shinchan had accidentally done something—
Something that made her heart race.
Something that made her freeze in place.
Something that made her blush so hard she couldn’t sleep for another hour.
And if anyone asked if something happened—
She would have to say yes.
"I AM GOING TO DIE."
Meanwhile, Shinchan, who had also remembered, just scratched his head awkwardly.
"...Well. At least we know why the whole school is talking about us now."
Ai turned to him, still bright red.
"SHIN. THIS IS BAD."
"Is it, though?" he asked, tilting his head.
She pointed at him accusingly.
"THE WHOLE SCHOOL THINKS WE’RE TOGETHER!"
"...Would that be so bad?" he muttered under his breath.
Ai almost missed it.
Almost.
But she heard it.
And suddenly, she forgot how to function.
Shinchan, oblivious to what he had just done to her brain, simply sighed.
"Welp. Time to go do my job as the president."
Ai just stared at him, frozen.
Heart pounding.
Face still red.
And completely unable to respond.
You said:
they some how defused the situation but it took a long week, and it didnt help that their friends were in their way.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 108 – A Week of Pure Suffering
Monday:
Shinchan and Ai had only just stepped into the school when they saw Kazama waiting for them, arms crossed, looking like a disappointed parent.
Behind him were Masao, Nene, Bo, Rika, Minami, Hayashi, Akari, and half of the student council.
And all of them had one expression.
Smug.
"Explain yourselves." Kazama demanded.
Ai, still traumatized from this morning, hid behind Shinchan.
"We just came to school together," Shin tried. "Like any normal student."
Nene gasped dramatically.
"AFTER STAYING THE NIGHT?!"
The crowd of gossipers around them exploded.
Ai squeaked.
Kazama adjusted his glasses.
"So, are you confirming the rumors?"
"No," Shin said flatly.
"Then deny them," Masao pushed.
"...No."
"THAT'S SUSPICIOUS!"
Ai finally snapped.
"NOTHING HAPPENED, OKAY?!"
The hallway went dead silent.
And then—
"Wait. So, you're saying something did happen?" Minami smirked.
Ai froze.
"I—NO! I DIDN’T MEAN—! I JUST—!"
Kazama nodded.
"I see. So, something did happen."
Shinchan just sighed.
This was going to be a long week.

Tuesday:
Shinchan and Ai thought it would die down.
They were so wrong.
In the middle of PE class, Ai was surrounded by a bunch of girls from different classes.
"Ai-chan! So, so, SOOO... is it true?"
"Is what true?" she asked, already exhausted.
"That you and Shin-chan spent the night together~"
Ai almost tripped over her own feet.
"W-Why are you saying it like that?!"
"It's soooo romantic~"
"IT WAS NOT!"
Meanwhile, Shinchan had his own problem.
The boys in his class surrounded him like he was some rare animal.
"Bro."
"Sensei."
"Master."
"TELL US YOUR SECRETS."
Shinchan just stared at them.
"My secrets?"
"HOW DID YOU DO IT?! THE AI-CHAN?!"
Shinchan frowned.
"...You guys make it sound like I defeated some final boss."
"BECAUSE YOU DID!"
Shinchan sighed.
At this point, he was considering faking his own death to escape.

Wednesday:
By lunchtime, Ai thought she was safe.
She was so wrong.
She was just about to eat when suddenly—
A piece of paper slid onto her desk.
Ai blinked.
And then, slowly, she picked it up.
It was a LOVE LETTER.
And the words "STAY AWAY FROM SHIN-CHAN" were written at the bottom.
She dropped it like it was on fire.
Shinchan, sitting next to her, peeked at the letter.
He looked at the sender.
Then at the "STAY AWAY FROM SHIN-CHAN" part.
Then at Ai.
Then back at the letter.
And then, finally—
He started laughing.
Ai glared at him.
"THIS IS NOT FUNNY!"
Shinchan, wiping a tear from his eye, just patted her shoulder.
"You know, you could frame this."
"I WILL THROW YOU INTO THE SUN."

Thursday:
They were getting close to clearing the rumors.
That was, until Bo-chan did the unthinkable.
In front of the entire student council, he casually muttered—
"Shin-chan and Ai-chan look good together."
And then walked away like nothing happened.
Shinchan and Ai froze.
And then, like hungry wolves, the rest of their friends pounced.
"BO-CHAN SAYS IT'S CANON!"
"CONGRATS ON YOUR MARRIAGE!"
"WHEN ARE THE WEDDING INVITES?!"
Ai hid her face.
Shinchan just sighed.

Friday:
Somehow, after one week of pain, suffering, and sheer willpower, the rumors finally started dying down.
Ai was exhausted.
Shinchan was exhausted.
The only ones who weren’t exhausted were their friends, because they spent the whole week ruining their lives for entertainment.
"Next time," Ai muttered, resting her head on the desk, "I’m never staying over."
Shinchan, arms crossed behind his head, just smirked.
"...Who said there’ll be a next time?"
Ai turned red.
And then hit him.
You said:
after all this event, the boys decide to sleep over at shin's house for the weekend too, for old sake.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 109 – Boys' Night at Shinchan’s Place
After a week of pure suffering, Shinchan thought he could finally have some peace.
He was so wrong.
"Shin-chan! We’re crashing at your place this weekend!"
Shinchan, who had just opened his shoe locker, slowly turned his head to Kazama, Masao, and Bo.
"...Why?"
Kazama adjusted his glasses.
"For old times' sake."
Masao nodded furiously.
"We used to sleep over all the time when we were kids! It’s only fair!"
Bo just blinked slowly.
"Also, your house has better snacks."
Shinchan sighed.
He should’ve expected this.

Saturday Night – The Chaos Begins
As soon as they arrived, Hima was there to greet them.
"Oh?" she smirked. "You guys are staying over? Sounds fun~"
Kazama frowned.
"...Why do I feel like you’re planning something?"
Hima grinned.
"Me? Oh no, I’m just a kind and innocent middle schooler."
Shinchan shivered.
"She’s planning something."
"She’s planning something."
Masao looked at them, confused.
"Eh? She’s just a kid—"
Hima suddenly pulled out her phone.
And in the next second, she had Ai on the line.
"Nee-chan~ Guess what? The boys are sleeping over at our place!"
Shinchan lunged.
"OI! WHO SAID YOU COULD CALL HER?!"
Kazama, Masao, and Bo froze.
Hima grinned.
"Just wanted to let her know~"
On the other end, Ai’s voice came through.
"...Oh? All of you? At Shin’s place?"
Shinchan grabbed the phone.
"Oi, don’t get any ideas!"
Ai laughed.
"Heh. Have fun, boys~"
Click.
Shinchan slowly turned to Hima.
She was already running away.
"You little—!"
And just like that, the night of chaos began.

Game Time
After dinner, they gathered in Shinchan’s room.
Kazama brought a board game.
Masao brought snacks.
Bo-chan brought... himself.
They started playing a nostalgic childhood game.
The Game of Life.
At first, it was peaceful.
Then Shinchan got rich.
Masao got a horrible job.
Kazama got too many taxes.
Bo-chan somehow ended up with ten kids.
And the game turned into pure war.
"THIS IS RIGGED!" Masao screamed.
"Why do I have so many kids?" Bo muttered.
Shinchan just smirked.
"Maybe it’s foreshadowing."
Kazama adjusted his glasses.
"If that’s the case, Shin-chan, why are you a millionaire bachelor?"
Shinchan shrugged.
"Sounds about right."

Late Night Talks
After they finished playing, they just lay on the floor, staring at the ceiling.
The vibe was... surprisingly nostalgic.
Masao stretched.
"Man... this is just like when we were kids."
Kazama nodded.
"...We really grew up, huh?"
Shinchan smirked.
"Speak for yourself. I’m still the same."
Masao snorted.
"Yeah, right. Mr. Kendo Champion. Mr. Student Council President. Mr.—"
Shinchan threw a pillow at him.
They all laughed.
For a moment, it felt like they were kids again.

The Next Morning
They woke up way too late.
Misae barged into the room.
"You brats better wake up before I throw water on you!"
Masao screamed.
Kazama jumped.
Bo-chan just slowly blinked awake.
Shinchan groaned.
"Ugh... never again."
Masao sat up.
"But it was fun, right?"
Shinchan glanced at them.
Then smirked.
"...Yeah. It was."
You said:
that day then before leaving hima invited them all, to her middle school cultural festival, especially to see her drama act of her class, also she called and invited ai and nene later. a few days later the grp crashed at her middle school for the event.

Chapter 110 – Middle School Mayhem
Shinchan should have known something was up when Hima smiled too sweetly while inviting them.
"Aniki, you and your friends should come to my school festival this weekend!"
Shinchan raised an eyebrow.
"...Why do I feel like there’s a trap?"
Hima giggled.
"Oh, and make sure Ai-nee and Nene-nee come too. You wouldn’t want to miss my class’s drama performance, right?"
Kazama adjusted his glasses.
"A drama performance? Sounds interesting."
Masao nodded.
"Yeah! We should support Hima-chan!"
Bo-chan simply blinked.
"She’s definitely planning something."
Shinchan sighed.
"Fine, fine. We’ll come."
And so, a few days later—
The entire group crashed Hima’s middle school festival.

Welcome to Middle School Hell
The moment they arrived, they stood out like sore thumbs.
Shinchan, Kazama, Masao, Bo, Ai, Nene, Rika, and even Minami and Hayashi—
A bunch of high schoolers invading a middle school festival.
"Are they seniors from our sister school?"
"Wait, isn’t that the legendary Kazama-sempai?"
"Holy crap, is that THE Shinchan?!"
Shinchan froze.
"Oi. Why do middle schoolers know me?"
Kazama facepalmed.
"Because you’re the student council president, kendo champion, and the guy who caused a week-long schoolwide rumor."
Shinchan clicked his tongue.
"Tch. Unavoidable fame."
Nene grinned.
"So, what do we check out first?"
Hima suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
"That would be my class’s haunted house!"
Shinchan narrowed his eyes.
"...Why do I feel like I shouldn’t trust this?"
Ai smirked.
"Are you scared, Shin?"
Shinchan scoffed.
"As if."
And so, they entered the haunted house.

Shinchan's Biggest Regret
The haunted house was...
Terrifying.
Too terrifying.
Middle schoolers should not be this talented.
Masao screamed like his soul left his body.
Kazama clung onto Shinchan’s arm.
Bo just walked normally.
Ai and Nene laughed.
And Shinchan?
"...These damn kids are too good at horror."
By the time they escaped, Shinchan swore never to trust Hima again.
Hima just smirked.
"Oh, but the festival’s just getting started~"

Hima's Drama Performance
Finally, the group arrived at the main event—Hima’s class drama.
They took their seats as the curtains lifted.
Shinchan read the title.
"The Tragic Love of the Samurai and the Princess."
He froze.
"Oi. OI. HIMA."
Hima was on stage in full princess attire.
And her co-star—
Kazama turned pale.
"...Is that Shiro?"
Yes.
Hima was playing the princess.
And her knight in shining armor was her childhood dog, Shiro, dressed in a samurai outfit.
The audience burst into laughter.
Shinchan held his face in his hands.
"...I hate my family."

Post-Performance Chaos
After the performance, the group confronted Hima.
Shinchan crossed his arms.
"Hima."
Hima beamed.
"Aniki~ Did you enjoy it?"
"...Why was Shiro the samurai?"
Hima shrugged.
"Because no boy in my class was good enough."
Kazama choked.
Masao wiped tears from laughing too much.
Bo just nodded in approval.
Ai and Nene patted Shinchan’s back.
"At least she has high standards, right?"
Shinchan sighed.
"Let’s just get food before I die of embarrassment."
And so, their middle school festival invasion ended in absolute chaos.
You said:
ai and shin explored together, so did nene and masao, and hima and kazama. bo and the rest of the grp were together.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 111 – Unofficial Middle School Dates
After the chaotic drama performance, the group naturally split up.
Shinchan and Ai wandered off together.


Nene and Masao ended up in their own little world.


Hima and Kazama mysteriously disappeared.


Bo-chan, Rika, Minami, and Hayashi stuck together as the "responsible" ones.


And so, each pair unknowingly turned the festival into their own date.

Shinchan & Ai – A Not-So-Secret Date
"Wanna get some takoyaki?"
Ai blinked.
"You? Offering to buy me food? This is new."
Shinchan smirked.
"Well, gotta make sure my secretary has enough energy to keep up with me."
Ai rolled her eyes but smiled.
They strolled through the festival, checking out stalls, completely oblivious to the middle schoolers whispering about them.
"Is that our sister school's student council president?!"
"Wait, wait! Who’s that girl with him?"
"That’s the secretary! No way, they came together?"
Shinchan and Ai sat down at a bench, eating their snacks, when Ai casually leaned in.
"So... do you really not care about all these rumors about us?"
Shinchan, mid-bite, froze.
"...Huh?"
Ai smirked.
"Everywhere we go, people whisper about us, thinking we’re a couple. Doesn’t it bother you?"
Shinchan tilted his head.
"Why would it?"
Ai stared.
Shinchan went back to eating.
"...You’re impossible."
She sighed and stole a bite of his food.
Shinchan just grinned.

Nene & Masao – Accidental Love Comedy
Meanwhile, Nene and Masao were checking out festival games.
Nene pointed at a ring toss stall.
"If you win, you get a big teddy bear!"
Masao gulped.
"...So you want it?"
Nene grinned.
"Of course!"
Masao took a deep breath, determined.
(Alright, Masao. This is your moment. Be cool. Be confident. Win her that prize.)
He stepped up, tossed the ring—
And missed.
Nene held back a laugh.
Masao tried again.
Missed.
The stall owner raised an eyebrow.
"Kid, you sure you don’t wanna stop?"
Masao’s eyes burned with unwavering determination.
"...I won’t leave until I win that bear."
20 failed attempts later—
The stall owner sighed.
"Fine. Just take it, kid."
Masao beamed and handed the giant teddy bear to Nene.
Nene took it and—
Hugged him instead.
"...You’re such an idiot, Masao."
Masao froze.
Then turned bright red.
Nene just laughed and held onto his arm as they walked.
Masao felt like he was floating.
(Was this... the power of love?)

Hima & Kazama – Unlikely Pairing
Kazama didn’t know how it happened.
One moment, he was walking with the group.
The next, Hima was dragging him around like an excited little kid.
"Kazama-niichan! Let’s check out the goldfish scooping!"
Kazama sighed.
"Hima-chan, I don’t think I’m very good at—"
Before he could finish, Hima was already playing.
Within seconds, she caught three goldfish.
Kazama blinked.
"...How are you so good at this?"
Hima beamed.
"Talent~"
Kazama shook his head, a small smile forming.
"Alright, let me try."
He took the paper scoop, carefully lowered it into the water—
And the paper immediately tore.
Hima burst out laughing.
Kazama glared.
"This game is rigged."
Hima kept laughing, but then she grabbed his hand.
"Here, I’ll help you."
Before Kazama could react, Hima was guiding his hand with hers, slowly moving the scoop—
Kazama froze.
(...This girl...)
His face heated up.
And that’s how Kazama ended up winning a goldfish without knowing how.
Hima just grinned.
"See? Told you I’d help!"
Kazama looked away.
"...T-Thanks."
(He felt like he just lost something.)

Bo & The Others – The Calm Group
While the other pairs were unknowingly wrapped in rom-com moments, Bo, Rika, Minami, and Hayashi were peacefully enjoying the festival.
They walked around, tried food, and casually observed the chaos.
Minami chuckled.
"You think they even realize they’re on unofficial dates?"
Rika smirked.
"Not a chance."
Hayashi nodded.
"This is good entertainment."
Bo just ate his food, unfazed.
"Mm."
And so, the festival continued—
With love, laughter, and absolute embarrassment waiting for later.
You said:
on the way home, shin saw kazama and hima having fun together, and instead of getting protective, he saw the smile on hima's face. they werent dating, or anything close to it. but as were shin chan had a talk with kazama about her sis not as comedic, but still not too serious, to try not play with her feelings he said. and as they talked kazama added that he himself didnt know what he fealt for her. but then they continued home still best friends. (note i dont want kazama to have glasses,i didnt mentioned it up till now, but he doesnt sit well with my interpretation of the charater). now chapter 112.

Updated saved memory
Got it! Continuing with Chapter 112.
Chapter 112
The group walked home together, the evening sky casting a warm orange glow over the city. Laughter and chatter filled the air, but Shinchan’s eyes kept drifting toward Kazama and Hima, who were walking a little ahead. Hima’s bright smile and the way she excitedly talked about the festival made Shin pause.
They weren’t dating. Not even close.
But still.
He slowed his steps, letting the others walk ahead until he and Kazama were side by side.
“Hey,” Shin started, his voice casual but with an edge of something more.
Kazama glanced at him. “What?”
Shin kept his eyes forward. “About my sister.”
Kazama blinked, clearly not expecting this conversation. “What about her?”
Shin’s usual teasing tone wasn’t there. “Just don’t play with her feelings, alright?”
Kazama opened his mouth to respond but hesitated. He wasn’t the type to play around, and they both knew that. Still, there was something about the way Shin said it—somewhere between a protective older brother and a best friend just looking out.
“…I don’t know what I feel,” Kazama admitted after a moment.
Shin looked at him for a second, then smirked, giving Kazama a hard pat on the back. “That makes two of us, buddy.”
Kazama rolled his eyes but didn’t argue.
And just like that, the moment passed, and they returned to their usual banter, the conversation dissolving into their normal rhythm. The others noticed nothing, and by the time they reached home, everything felt just as it always had been.
Best friends.
And maybe, just maybe, something more waiting in the future.
Continued in Chapter 113.

redo, make it long and conversation on your own too.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 112
The group walked down the quiet street, the buzz of the middle school festival still lingering in the air. Streetlights flickered on as the sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the city in hues of deep orange and purple. Laughter filled the air as Masao recounted his disastrous attempt at a shooting game, and Nene scolded him for being too easy to trick.
Shinchan, hands in his pockets, walked at a steady pace, letting the conversations swirl around him. But his eyes kept drifting to Kazama and Hima, walking slightly ahead.
They weren’t holding hands. They weren’t walking too close. They weren’t even doing anything suspicious.
But the way Hima’s face lit up, the way Kazama actually smiled instead of giving his usual sigh of annoyance—it felt... different.
For once, Shin didn’t feel the urge to tease.
Instead, he found himself slowing his steps, falling behind just enough for Kazama to notice.
Kazama arched a brow. “What’s up?”
Shin didn’t answer right away. He stared ahead at Hima, who was excitedly talking about the drama she’d performed in. She was practically glowing.
His little sister.
Finally, he let out a sigh. “About my sister.”
Kazama blinked. “Huh?”
Shin turned his head slightly, just enough to meet Kazama’s gaze. There was no humor in his expression, no smirk, no teasing. Just a rare moment of straightforwardness.
“Just don’t play with her feelings.”
Kazama stopped walking.
The others, too caught up in their own conversations, didn’t notice as Shin also came to a stop beside him. The streetlight above them buzzed softly, casting their shadows on the pavement.
“…You’re seriously asking me that?” Kazama finally said.
Shin shrugged. “Yeah.”
Kazama’s lips pressed into a thin line. “I’m not like that, Shin. You should know that by now.”
Shin nodded slowly. “I do. But it’s my job as her older brother to say something anyway.”
Kazama scoffed. “Since when do you take your ‘older brother’ job seriously?”
Shin smirked. “Since my sister started smiling like that around you.”
Kazama’s eyes widened slightly, but he quickly masked it. He looked away, running a hand through his hair. “…I don’t even know what I feel.”
Shin studied him for a moment before letting out a short laugh. “That makes two of us, buddy.”
Kazama let out a slow breath and shook his head. “You’re an idiot.”
Shin grinned. “And you’re getting nervous over nothing. Chill out.”
Kazama rolled his eyes. “I’m not nervous.”
“Sure, sure,” Shin said, patting his shoulder hard enough to make Kazama stumble a step forward. “Just don’t make my sister cry, okay?”
Kazama sighed but didn’t argue.
By then, the others had noticed their absence and turned back to call them.
“Hurry up, slowpokes!” Masao shouted.
“What are you two whispering about?” Nene asked suspiciously.
Shin threw an arm around Kazama’s shoulders, grinning. “Kazama was just confessing his love for me.”
Kazama shoved him off immediately. “Like hell I was!”
The group burst into laughter, and just like that, the tension disappeared.
And as they continued home, Shin realized something—he might not be the overprotective type, but when it came to his sister, he wasn’t completely indifferent either.
Maybe, just maybe, some things were worth taking seriously.
To be continued in Chapter 113.
You said:
a few days later a misunderstanding happens between masao and nene, leading to a fight.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 113
The school day had started like any other—Shinchan was dozing off in class, Ai was shooting him occasional glares for not paying attention, Kazama was taking meticulous notes, Bo was quietly existing, and Masao… well, Masao seemed a little off.
It wasn’t until lunch that the shift in atmosphere became obvious.
“Masao, you coming to eat with us?” Bo asked as they all packed their things.
Masao, who usually would have lit up at the invitation, only muttered, “I’ll eat later,” before heading off on his own.
The group exchanged looks.
“…That’s weird,” Nene muttered, crossing her arms. “He didn’t even call me ‘Nene-chan’ like he always does.”
“Maybe he’s just tired,” Kazama offered.
Shinchan, who had been watching Masao’s retreating figure, smirked. “Or maybe he’s upset at a certain someone.”
Nene frowned. “What do you mean?”
Shin shrugged. “Dunno. But if I had to guess… did you do something to make him mad?”
“Me?” Nene scoffed. “As if. I’d remember if I did.”
But something in her expression shifted slightly, as if she was second-guessing herself.
Ai raised an eyebrow. “What if it’s not something you did, but something he thinks you did?”
At that, Nene blinked. “…Huh?”
—
Masao, meanwhile, sat outside behind the school building, moodily stabbing at his lunch with his chopsticks.
His mind replayed what he’d seen the day before—Nene, standing outside the school gate, laughing with some guy from another class. And not just casual laughing. That stupid giggle she always made when she was having fun.
Masao stabbed at his rice harder.
He didn’t know why it bugged him so much. It wasn’t like they were… dating or anything. Sure, they were close. Sure, they were partnered up a lot. Sure, they—
He groaned, dropping his chopsticks.
“Stupid.”
“Who’s stupid?”
Masao jumped at the sudden voice. Looking up, he found Shinchan leaning against the wall with a knowing smirk.
“…No one.”
Shinchan plopped down next to him. “That’s a lie. You only ever sulk like this when it’s Nene-related.”
Masao stiffened. “It’s not Nene-related.”
Shinchan hummed. “Suuure.”
Masao sighed, rubbing his face. “I just… I don’t get her, man.”
“Most guys don’t get girls.”
Masao shot him a look. “You’re one to talk.”
Shinchan grinned. “Fair point. But I’m not the one pouting over Nene laughing with some dude.”
Masao turned red. “I’m not—! I don’t care about that!”
Shinchan simply stared at him, unconvinced.
Masao’s shoulders slumped. “Okay… maybe it bugged me a little.”
“There it is.”
Masao groaned. “I don’t even like her like that, so why does it annoy me?”
Shinchan stretched lazily. “Who knows? Maybe you secretly do.”
Masao choked. “Absolutely not.”
Shinchan just grinned, but before he could say anything else—
“MASAO!”
The furious voice of Nene cut through the air, and both boys turned to see her storming toward them, eyes blazing.
“Uh-oh,” Shinchan muttered, standing up. “Welp, my job’s done here.”
Masao grabbed his sleeve. “Don’t leave me—!”
Too late. Shinchan was already walking off, whistling.
Nene stopped in front of Masao, hands on her hips. “Alright, spill it. What’s your problem?”
Masao scowled. “I don’t have a problem.”
“Then why have you been acting like a moody idiot all day?”
“I could say the same about you!”
“I haven’t been moody!”
Masao scoffed. “Oh, please. You’ve been avoiding me too.”
Nene’s eyes narrowed. “Because you were the one sulking first!”
The two glared at each other.
Then Nene huffed. “If you’re mad about something, just say it already!”
Masao clenched his fists. “Fine! Who was that guy?”
Nene blinked. “What?”
“The guy you were laughing with yesterday! Outside the school gate!”
It took her a second to realize what he meant. And then—
She burst out laughing.
Masao’s face turned even redder. “Wh-What’s so funny?!”
Nene wiped a tear from her eye. “That’s what this is about?! You idiot, that was my cousin!”
Masao froze. “…What?”
“My cousin! He was visiting from out of town and came to pick something up for my mom!”
Masao stared at her.
And then, as the realization hit, he groaned loudly and buried his face in his hands.
“…I am so stupid.”
Nene smirked. “Yep.”
Masao groaned again. “I thought—ugh, never mind.”
“Oh no, please continue,” Nene teased. “You thought what, exactly?”
Masao refused to answer.
Nene poked his shoulder. “Come on, Masao-kun, tell meee~”
Masao swatted her hand away, mumbling, “Nothing, okay? I was just being dumb.”
Nene grinned, satisfied. “You are dumb. But at least now I know why you were acting like a jealous little kid.”
Masao spluttered. “I—I was not jealous!”
“Sure, sure,” Nene said, patting his head mockingly. “But next time, instead of throwing a fit, how about actually asking before assuming things?”
Masao muttered something under his breath.
Nene smirked. “What was that?”
“…Fine.”
“Good!” She spun on her heel. “Now come on, I’m starving.”
Masao sighed, standing up to follow her.
And as they walked back to the cafeteria, Masao realized something—
Shinchan was definitely going to make fun of him for this.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 114
Lunch break was buzzing with the usual noise—students chatting, laughing, and enjoying their food under the warm afternoon sun. The student council members and their extended group had once again gathered in their usual spot, though today, something unexpected was about to happen.
Bo was, as always, quietly eating his lunch, nodding along whenever someone addressed him but mostly keeping to himself. His usual air of tranquility remained undisturbed—until Rika showed up.
"Oi, Hayashi, I swear you rigged that game last time!" Rika shouted as she stomped toward the group, pointing at Hayashi.
"I did not rig it! You're just bad at it," Hayashi shot back with an amused smirk.
Rika growled. "Say that again, and I'll—whoa!"
It all happened in a flash.
One moment, Rika was storming forward. The next, her foot caught on a stray bench, and she lost her balance. She let out a small gasp, flailing as she braced for impact.
But she never hit the ground.
Instead, a firm hand caught her wrist, smoothly pulling her back into balance.
Rika blinked, stunned, and looked up—
Only to see Bo standing there, completely unfazed, as if catching falling people was just another part of his daily routine.
"Careful," Bo said in his usual calm tone before letting go and returning to his lunch.
Silence.
Then—
"Whoa," Shinchan muttered. "That was kinda cool."
Even Kazama, who usually had something sarcastic to say, just nodded. "Impressive reflexes."
Masao, meanwhile, was practically sparkling. "That was like something straight out of a romance manga!"
Nene smirked. "Well, well, Rika, getting saved by a knight in shining armor. That’s a first."
Rika, still frozen in place, blinked rapidly. Her face—just moments ago full of frustration—was now turning an unusual shade of red.
"Wha—? I wasn’t—I just tripped!" she sputtered.
Ai tilted her head. "No one said anything about you falling for him, you know."
Rika turned even redder. "I didn’t fall for him!"
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. "We were talking about you tripping, but now we’re talking about falling, huh?"
More laughter.
Rika crossed her arms, flustered. “Shut up! It was nothing!”
She turned on her heel and stomped away, muttering curses under her breath.
But as she left, she stole a glance back at Bo.
Bo, completely unaware of the turmoil he had just caused, continued eating his lunch in peace.
And for the first time, Rika noticed something.
The sunlight hit him just right, giving him a cool, effortless aura. His quiet demeanor, which she had always thought of as dull, now seemed… mysterious? No, that was dumb. But the way he caught her, how easy it was for him, how natural—
Her heart skipped a beat.
Rika shook her head violently.
No way. No way. No way. It’s just because of what they said. That’s it. There’s nothing more to it.
…Right?
—
But it didn’t stop there.
The next few days, every time she was near Bo, her face would heat up for no reason at all.
When he handed her a paper in class? Blush.
 When their hands accidentally brushed while reaching for something? Blush.
 When he merely existed in her line of sight? Blush.
It was infuriating.
Rika groaned, slamming her head on her desk.
“Something wrong?” Ai asked, sitting beside her.
“…I might be seeing Bo differently ever since that happened.”
Ai smirked. “Oh?”
“It’s not a thing!” Rika hissed. “It’s just… I keep remembering how he caught me so effortlessly. It’s like… he was kind of—"
“Cool?” Ai finished.
Rika made a strangled noise.
Ai giggled. “You totally have a crush.”
“I do not!”
But her traitorous red face said otherwise.
To be continued…

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 115
For the next few days, Rika found herself trapped in a personal nightmare—one where she couldn’t look at Bo without her brain short-circuiting.
It was frustrating. No, beyond frustrating. Why was she like this? He was still the same Bo. Quiet, weird, blank-faced Bo. The same guy who could probably stare at a wall for hours and be perfectly content. The same guy who barely reacted to anything.
And yet, her heart still had the audacity to skip a beat every time he was around.
It didn’t help that their usual group noticed her change in behavior.
“Rika, you’ve been staring at Bo for a while now,” Nene teased, leaning in. “Thinking about something?”
“I—I was not staring!” Rika shot back, flustered.
Kazama adjusted his collar. “It’s kind of obvious. You’ve been acting weird.”
Masao, ever the hopeless romantic, gasped dramatically. “Could it be?! Has love blossomed?!”
“NO, IT HASN’T!”
But her burning face told a different story.
Meanwhile, Bo, the center of all this, was just drinking his juice box, completely unaware of the crisis he had caused.
Shinchan smirked. “You sure? I mean, you were kinda swooning the other day.”
“I WAS NOT—!”
She groaned, slamming her forehead against the table.
Ai leaned in, clearly enjoying this too much. “Just admit it, Rika. You like him.”
Rika gritted her teeth. “No. No, I don’t. That would be ridiculous.”
“Why?”
“Because he’s Bo!”
The entire table fell silent for a moment.
Then Nene said, “And?”
Rika groaned again, burying her face in her hands. This was a disaster.
—
Things only got worse when Bo unknowingly made things worse.
It was after school, and the group was hanging out in the student council office again because of the air conditioning.
Rika, trying to distract herself, was helping Ai organize some documents when suddenly—
“Hey, Rika.”
She turned.
Bo was standing right next to her, holding out a bottle of water.
“You were spacing out. Drink this.”
That was it. That was all he said.
But for some reason, that simple action made her heartbeat explode.
“Wh— I wasn’t spacing out!” she stammered.
Bo blinked. “You were.”
“No, I wasn’t!”
“Okay.” He still handed her the bottle. “But drink anyway.”
Rika’s face was on fire.
She snatched the bottle from him, chugging half of it just to avoid looking at him.
In the background, Nene and Ai were giggling.
Even Shinchan, who had been lounging lazily, raised an eyebrow. “Hoooh? Bo-kun, that was kinda smooth.”
Bo blinked. “Was it?”
Kazama sighed. “Honestly, I don’t think he even realizes what he’s doing.”
Masao, on the verge of tears, grabbed Bo’s shoulder. “Teach me your ways, master.”
Bo, still entirely clueless, just sipped his juice.
Meanwhile, Rika—now too flustered to function—decided she needed to leave immediately.
“Gotta go! Bye!” she blurted out before speed-walking out of the room.
The moment she was gone, Ai grinned. “Oh yeah. She’s done for.”
Nene nodded. “Absolutely.”
Shinchan smirked. “This is gonna be fun to watch.”
Bo just blinked, then sipped his juice again.

next chapter the coucil has a burden of work again, but shin is excited, they have to pass a school wide poll to decide the place they will go for the school trip.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 116
The student council room was buried under stacks of paperwork. Forms, documents, and proposals covered every inch of the desks. The air conditioner hummed in the background, barely keeping up with the body heat of the group crammed inside.
Most of the council members looked like they were suffering.
Kazama rubbed his temples. “I swear, it’s like every time we clear one task, another mountain of work appears.”
Nene groaned, her head hitting the table. “Why do we even have this much responsibility? We’re not running the country, it’s just a school!”
Ai sighed dramatically. “This is the burden of being important, Nene-chan.”
Masao, already on his second energy drink, looked dead inside. “I wasn’t meant for this life…”
Meanwhile, Shinchan, the source of all their misery, was practically glowing.
“This is gonna be great!” he declared, slapping a huge stack of proposals onto the table. “We get to decide where the school goes for the trip! This is a huge responsibility!”
Kazama squinted at him. “Why are you so excited? You hate paperwork.”
Shinchan smirked. “Yeah, but I love chaos.”
Everyone collectively groaned.
Ai rolled her eyes but couldn’t help smiling. “So? What’s the plan, President?”
Shinchan grinned. “Simple. We hold a school-wide poll. We let the students decide where they want to go!”
Nene perked up. “Oh! That actually sounds pretty reasonable.”
Kazama nodded. “For once, I agree. It’s democratic and prevents us from being blamed if people don’t like the choice.”
Shinchan winked. “Exactly. If they get mad, it’s their fault.”
Masao sighed in relief. “Oh, thank god, for a second I thought you were going to choose something ridiculous.”
Shinchan stretched. “Well, I was gonna just pick an onsen town so I could be lazy the whole trip, but now that everyone’s involved, we might get something interesting.”
Ai smirked. “And what if the poll results end up being an onsen town anyway?”
Shinchan blinked. “Then democracy is a wonderful thing.”
Nene giggled. “So, how are we gonna do this poll?”
Kazama pulled out a notepad. “We’ll need to narrow down the choices first. If we let every student submit their own suggestion, we’ll end up with too many options.”
Shinchan nodded. “Right, we’ll set up a first round where students submit ideas, and then we’ll shortlist the most popular ones.”
Ai twirled a pen in her fingers. “We should have at least four solid options for the final vote. Something for everyone.”
Bo, who had been silent the entire time, finally spoke.
“Food.”
Everyone turned to him.
Shinchan grinned. “Yeah, you’re right, Bo-chan. We gotta make sure at least one option has amazing food.”
Bo nodded in approval.
Masao hesitated. “Wait… what if the teachers veto the most popular choice?”
Kazama adjusted his tie. “That’s a valid concern. We should run the shortlisted options by the faculty first.”
Shinchan waved a hand. “Leave that to me. I’ll use my presidential charm to convince them.”
Kazama sighed. “That’s what I’m afraid of.”
—
The rest of the afternoon was spent organizing the first round of voting. Posters were designed, announcement scripts were written, and Ai handled the digital side of things by setting up an online voting system.
By the time they finished, the sun was setting.
Shinchan stretched, looking at the final draft of the poll announcement. “Alright! The first round opens tomorrow. Let’s see what kind of chaos this school throws at us.”
Kazama massaged his temples. “Why do you sound excited about that?”
Shinchan smirked. “Because school trips aren’t just about the place. It’s about the drama leading up to them.”
Ai shook her head, laughing. “You’re impossible.”
Nene grinned. “Well, at least it won’t be boring.”
Masao groaned. “I just want a stress-free trip…”
Bo, finishing the last sip of his juice box, simply said, “Food.”
And with that, the student council braced themselves for the chaos to come.

Chapter 117
The entire school gathered in the gymnasium for the big announcement. Anticipation buzzed through the air as students whispered excitedly about the final destination of the school trip. Some were hopeful for an exotic beachside retreat, others wanted a bustling city, and a few were just praying for somewhere with good food.
On stage, standing behind the microphone, Shinchan grinned mischievously, his posture relaxed, but his aura commanding attention.
Kazama stood beside him, sighing deeply. “Can you not drag this out?”
Shinchan ignored him, dramatically clearing his throat.
“Ladies and gentlemen! Students and teachers! Disciplinary committee members and people who like to snitch for fun—”
The teachers collectively frowned.
“We have tallied the votes! The moment you’ve all been waiting for… the grand revelation of our school trip destination!”
The crowd leaned in.
Shinchan smirked, milking the moment. “In third place… an onsen town.”
Some groaned in disappointment, while a few fist-pumped in the background.
“In second place… a mountain lodge for outdoor activities.”
A few sporty students nodded approvingly.
“And now…” Shinchan held the envelope in his hand, tilting his head with a smirk. “The destination that won by an overwhelming margin… The place where our memories will be forged in either bliss or regret…”
Kazama sighed. “Just say it already.”
Shinchan tore open the envelope.
“Our school trip destination is… KYOTO!”
The crowd erupted in cheers. Kyoto was a perfect balance—it had history, sightseeing, food, shopping, and a ton of romantic spots that made half the school blush at the thought.
Ai grinned. “Ohh, Kyoto! That’s a solid win.”
Nene clasped her hands together. “The temples, the shrines, the street food—this is perfect!”
Masao wiped his forehead in relief. “At least it’s not a survival trip…”
Bo simply nodded. “Good food.”
Kazama adjusted his tie, satisfied. “I suppose this is a reasonable choice.”
Shinchan leaned toward him. “You sound happy, Kazama-kun. Got any romantic spots in mind?”
Kazama immediately turned red. “W-What are you talking about?!”
Shinchan just patted his shoulder knowingly.

Weekend – Last-Minute Shopping
The group decided to split up for their final shopping trip before the trip.
Boys' Group: Shinchan, Kazama, Masao, and Bo.
 Girls' Group: Ai, Nene, Rika, and (after much convincing) Hima.
The girls technically invited Ai’s rich friend (Yuka), but she declined, saying, “I already have people for that,” while sipping a fancy drink.
—
Boys’ Group – Shopping Chaos
Kazama checked his list. “Okay, we need essentials—extra clothes, travel-sized toiletries, and—”
Shinchan interrupted, holding up a ridiculous souvenir hat. “What do you think? Will this make me look mysterious?”
Masao sighed. “Why do you even need a souvenir before the trip?”
Shinchan shrugged. “Gotta prepare for the unexpected.”
Bo grabbed a box of Kyoto sweets from a shelf and placed it in his basket.
Kazama blinked. “We’re not even there yet.”
Bo didn’t respond.
Masao nervously checked his wallet. “I have to budget carefully…”
Shinchan threw an arm around him. “Don’t worry, Masao. If we run out of money, we can just beg Ai-chan to cover us.”
Kazama sighed. “Please don’t.”
—
Girls’ Group – Shopping and Teasing
The girls, on the other hand, were much more organized. They went through their lists efficiently, picking up everything they needed, but of course, the real fun came from teasing Ai.
Hima smirked. “So, Onee-chan, are you planning on making any romantic moves on this trip?”
Ai scoffed. “What are you talking about? It’s just a school trip.”
Nene grinned. “You’re so obvious. Kyoto has tons of romantic spots. Are you gonna pull Shin-chan under a sakura tree or something?”
Ai crossed her arms. “As if he’d even notice.”
Rika leaned in. “Then you should make him notice.”
Ai glanced away, a slight blush creeping up.
Nene suddenly gasped. “Wait! What if something happens between Shin-chan and some random Kyoto girl?”
Ai immediately stiffened.
Hima giggled. “Now she’s thinking about it.”
Ai groaned. “You guys are the worst.”
—
By the time both groups finished their shopping, they reunited outside the mall, ready for their upcoming trip.
As Shinchan stretched, he grinned. “Alright, Kyoto. You better be ready, ‘cause we’re coming.”
Ai smirked. “You should be more worried about us handling you there.”
Kazama sighed. “I already know this trip is going to be exhausting.”
Bo? He was already eating the Kyoto sweets he bought.

Chapter 118 – The Trip Begins
The long-awaited day had finally arrived. The once-small friend group—now considerably larger—gathered at the train station, excitement buzzing through the air.
Shinchan stretched his arms, his duffel bag lazily slung over his shoulder. “Man, I love school trips. It’s basically a vacation with friends.”
Kazama sighed, adjusting his neatly packed suitcase. “It’s not just a vacation. We still have educational activities and responsibilities as student council members.”
Ai smirked. “You sound so excited, Kazama-kun.”
“Unlike some people, I take things seriously.”
Masao wiped his forehead. “I just hope we don’t end up lost or in trouble.”
Bo simply nodded. “Good food.”
As they waited for their train, Nene checked her bag. “Alright! Everyone packed everything, right?”
Rika swung her kendo bag over her shoulder. “Wouldn’t be me if I didn’t bring my shinai.”
Shinchan grinned. “You planning on dueling someone in Kyoto?”
Rika shrugged. “Never know when you’ll need it.”
Minami and Akari stood to the side, casually talking amongst themselves, while Hayashi checked his phone with a lazy expression.
Ai glanced around. “Alright, everyone’s here. Let’s board.”
—
On the Train
The moment they settled in their seats, Shinchan was already in maximum relaxation mode—arms behind his head, legs stretched out as far as possible (which Kazama promptly smacked down).
The seating arrangements naturally formed:
Shinchan, Ai, and Kazama together.


Masao, Nene, and Bo.


Rika, Minami, Hayashi, and Akari.


As the train started moving, the atmosphere was filled with excitement and chatter.
Masao, looking out the window, sighed happily. “I’ve never been on a trip this big before…”
Nene nudged him. “Well, it’s gonna be fun—unless you trip during a tour and cause a domino effect.”
Masao turned pale. “D-Don’t jinx it!”
Meanwhile, Shinchan leaned back, nudging Kazama. “Man, you’re still all stiff. Loosen up. We’re heading to Kyoto! This is prime ‘high school memory’ material.”
Kazama adjusted his tie. “I am relaxed. I just don’t want you ruining this trip with one of your idiotic antics.”
Ai smirked. “Too late. He’s already plotting something.”
Shinchan dramatically placed a hand over his heart. “Ai-chan, how could you assume such a thing?”
Kazama and Ai deadpanned at him.
Shinchan just grinned.
—
Train Ride Shenanigans
Somewhere along the ride, a war broke out.
Shinchan had challenged Rika and Hayashi to a “who can stack the most snacks on Bo before he notices” competition.
Bo, sitting quietly with his arms crossed, did not react as the tower of convenience store snacks reached an absurd height.
Nene stifled a giggle. “How is he not noticing?”
Ai, arms crossed, watched unimpressed. “Honestly, I’m more impressed by his self-control.”
Just as Rika was about to place another snack, Bo blinked, picked up the top snack, opened it, and started eating.
The entire group burst into laughter.
—
Meanwhile, in the ‘Sane’ Section
Minami sighed, shaking his head. “How did this become our student council?”
Akari chuckled. “Honestly, it makes things more fun.”
Kazama, from across the seats, pinched the bridge of his nose. “I regret my position every day.”
—
As the train sped toward Kyoto, the group’s energy remained high. This was just the beginning.
And with Shinchan in the mix, Kyoto was guaranteed to be anything but normal.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 119 – Kyoto Begins
The train ride had been a mix of chaos and excitement, but as soon as they arrived at Kyoto Station, the group snapped into travel mode. Well, most of them.
Shinchan stretched, taking a deep breath of the Kyoto air. “Ahhh~! Smell that? That’s the smell of a legendary trip beginning.”
Kazama rolled his eyes. “That’s just the smell of the station, Shinchan.”
“Details, details.”
Ai adjusted her bag. “Alright, let’s drop our luggage at the hotel before we start sightseeing.”
—
Room Assignments
The group arrived at their hotel, an elegant but comfortable traditional inn that had been arranged for the students. The rooms were assigned as follows:
Room 1 (Boys): Shinchan, Kazama, Hayashi, Yasuo.


Room 2 (Girls): Nene, Ai, Rika, Akari.


Room 3 (Boys): Bo, Minami, Masao, Ren.


“Looks like we’re bunking together,” Hayashi said with a smirk, slapping Yasuo on the back.
Yasuo, the blonde ex-member of the Rose Group from their kindergarten days, grinned. “Man, this is gonna be fun. Haven’t had a school trip in ages.”
Kazama sighed. “Just don’t cause a mess.”
Shinchan threw his bag into the room. “Kazama, we both know that’s impossible.”
Meanwhile, the girls were settling into their room, Rika stretching her arms. “I love staying in traditional-style inns. It feels right.”
Nene flopped onto a futon. “I’m already claiming this spot.”
Ai smirked. “We haven’t even been here ten minutes, and you’re setting up camp?”
“Strategic placement.”
Akari chuckled. “Let’s just make sure we don’t spend all our time in here.”
With their luggage settled, the group reconvened in the lobby, ready to hit the city.
—
Exploring Kyoto
Their first stop? Kiyomizu-dera Temple.
The group walked up the famous slope leading to the temple, soaking in the sights and sounds of Kyoto.
Shinchan, hands in his pockets, whistled. “Man, this place is beautiful. Almost makes me want to take this trip seriously.”
Kazama crossed his arms. “You should be taking it seriously.”
Ai raised an eyebrow. “Shinchan? Taking things seriously? That would be a miracle.”
Masao nervously looked around. “Guys, we should probably stay close. It’s really crowded here…”
“Which is why we should form teams,” Rika suggested. “Otherwise, someone’s bound to get lost.”
After a bit of shuffling, the group naturally split into:
Shinchan, Ai, Kazama, Hayashi, and Yasuo


Nene, Masao, Rika, and Akari


Bo, Minami, and Ren


Each group set off to explore different parts of the temple, promising to meet up later.
—
Shinchan’s Group
As they walked through the temple grounds, Ai glanced at Shinchan. “You know, there’s a legend that if you can walk between the two love stones with your eyes closed, you’ll find true love.”
Shinchan smirked. “Sounds like a scam to me.”
Hayashi chuckled. “Come on, man, give it a shot.”
Kazama pushed up his sleeves. “If we let Shinchan try, he’ll probably trip and fall.”
Yasuo grinned. “Sounds entertaining. I say he goes for it.”
Ai nudged Shinchan playfully. “Unless you’re scared?”
Shinchan rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine. Watch a pro at work.”
He confidently stepped forward, closed his eyes, and… took two steps before slamming straight into a random tourist.
The group lost it.
Ai wiped tears from her eyes. “You were saying, pro?”
Shinchan groaned. “That tourist blocked me!”
Kazama sighed. “You were facing the wrong direction.”
Shinchan waved him off. “Details, details.”
—
Nene’s Group
Meanwhile, Nene, Masao, Rika, and Akari were enjoying some local sweets at a nearby stall.
Masao looked at the matcha-flavored dango on his stick. “This is so good…”
Nene took a bite of hers. “See? I told you Kyoto snacks are top-tier.”
Rika, holding a taiyaki, glanced at Bo’s group in the distance. Specifically, at Bo himself. She quickly looked away, feeling her face heat up.
Akari, noticing this, smirked. “Something wrong, Rika?”
“N-Nothing! Just… this taiyaki is really hot.”
Akari gave her a knowing look but said nothing.
—
Bo’s Group
Bo, Minami, and Ren were silently admiring the temple’s architecture.
Ren sighed. “You guys ever think about how ancient places like this make our school seem so… ordinary?”
Minami nodded. “Yeah. It’s humbling.”
Bo simply nodded, eating his own dango.
—
Regrouping
As the sun began to set, the entire group met back at the temple entrance.
Shinchan stretched. “Welp, that was fun.”
Ai smirked. “I think the highlight was your failed love stone challenge.”
Kazama crossed his arms. “At least we didn’t lose anyone.”
Masao exhaled. “Barely.”
With that, the group made their way back to the hotel, already looking forward to the next day of adventures.
To be continued…

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 120 – Late Night Shenanigans
The night was young, and after a long day of traveling, sightseeing, and stuffing themselves with Kyoto’s finest cuisine, the group finally returned to the inn. But the real fun was just about to begin.

A Relaxing Onsen Trip? Not Quite.
The boys and girls split up to enjoy the inn’s onsen, each heading to their respective bath.
Boys’ Side
Shinchan sank into the steaming water with a sigh of absolute relaxation. “Ahhh~ This is the life.”
Kazama adjusted his towel on his head. “At least you’re appreciating something properly for once.”
Yasuo smirked. “Man, I forgot how good a proper onsen feels.”
Masao, sitting at the edge, looked nervous. “Uhh… w-what if someone comes in…?”
Bo, as usual, remained silent but seemed perfectly at peace.
Hayashi grinned. “You’re in an onsen, Masao. What do you think is gonna happen?”
Shinchan grinned mischievously. “I could make something happen…”
Kazama immediately shut him down. “No.”
Yasuo leaned forward. “So, anyone thinking of peeking at the girls’ side?”
Everyone turned to him, unimpressed.
“Dude, we’re not middle schoolers,” Kazama said.
Shinchan, however, rubbed his chin in mock thought. “Now that depends on what you mean by ‘peeking.’”
Kazama punched his shoulder. “No.”
Bo, despite usually staying quiet, casually added, “I don’t think you’d survive it.”
Shinchan crossed his arms. “Hey, have some faith in me! My stealth skills are legendary!”
Hayashi smirked. “Legendary failures, maybe.”
They continued soaking in the water, chatting about random things—mostly about sports, school, and what they planned to do tomorrow.

Girls’ Side
On the other side, things were just as lively.
Nene stretched, leaning back into the warm water. “Now this is perfect.”
Ai smiled, her face glowing from the heat. “It’s been a while since we’ve had a trip like this.”
Akari smirked. “So, should we talk about you and Shin?”
Ai immediately sank deeper into the water. “There’s nothing to talk about.”
Rika, sitting quietly, suddenly spoke up. “You did stay at his place that one night, though…”
Nene and Akari turned to Ai with huge smirks.
Ai glared. “It wasn’t like that!”
Nene chuckled. “Sure, sure~”
Akari sighed dramatically. “Ahhh, young love. If only Minami were more like Shin.”
Rika, on the other hand, was distracted, stealing glances at Bo through the steam—except, well, Bo wasn’t there. But her brain kept replaying the moment he caught her earlier.
Nene noticed and nudged her. “Oi, Rika. You good?”
Rika shook her head quickly. “Huh? Yeah! Fine! Totally fine.”
Nene narrowed her eyes but let it go… for now.

Late-Night Chaos Begins
After everyone had their fill of the onsen, they changed into their yukatas and returned to their rooms. But, of course, no one was actually planning to sleep yet.
The girls had already gathered in one room, sprawled across the futons, chatting and snacking on the sweets they had bought earlier.
On the boys’ side, however, something else was brewing.
Shinchan looked around at the others. “Alright, gentlemen, the night is young. What’s the plan?”
Yasuo grinned. “Scary stories?”
Hayashi smirked. “Truth or dare?”
Masao gulped. “C-Can we do something less scary…?”
Kazama, ever the responsible one, sighed. “Why do I feel like this is going to go horribly wrong?”
Shinchan clapped his hands. “BOTH, then!”
The room erupted in a mix of excitement and groans.

Meanwhile, in the Girls’ Room…
Nene stretched her arms. “So, should we prank the boys?”
Akari smirked. “I like the way you think.”
Ai sighed. “You guys are gonna drag me into this, aren’t you?”
Rika, however, was staring at the wall, deep in thought.
“Rika?” Nene poked her.
Rika snapped out of it. “H-Huh?”
Nene smirked. “You’re thinking about something.”
Ai raised an eyebrow. “Or someone?”
Rika’s face went red.
Akari gasped. “Wait… Bo?”
Rika immediately buried herself under the futon. “GO TO SLEEP.”
Nene and Akari grinned at each other.
“Oh, this is good,” Nene whispered.
Ai sighed. “You two are incorrigible…”

The Prank War Begins
As the boys were in the middle of their “Truth or Dare” game (which had already resulted in Shinchan having to wear Masao’s socks on his head), a sudden knock came at the door.
Shinchan, suspicious, narrowed his eyes. “Who is it?”
Silence.
Kazama raised an eyebrow. “It’s obviously them.”
Another knock.
Then… whispering.
Masao paled. “I-It’s a ghost…?”
Hayashi rolled his eyes. “Or the girls pretending to be a ghost.”
Shinchan smirked. “Well, if they wanna play dirty, then let’s counterattack.”
Yasuo grinned. “I like the sound of that.”
Shinchan whispered his plan to the others.

Five Minutes Later
The girls, still giggling, waited outside.
“They’re taking a while to open the door,” Nene whispered.
Ai crossed her arms. “I told you this wasn’t a good idea.”
Akari smirked. “They’re probably too scared to check.”
Rika, standing slightly behind, was still flustered from the earlier teasing.
Then—
BAM!
The boys slammed the door open, making terrifying monster noises, with Shinchan and Yasuo leading the charge in makeshift ghost costumes made out of blankets.
The girls SCREAMED.
“RETREAT!” Akari yelled, but it was too late.
Nene tripped over her yukata, Ai got caught in the chaos, and Rika somehow ended up face to face with Bo, who had simply followed along, arms crossed.
The room exploded into laughter and chaos as everyone tried to recover from the mess they had made.

Eventually…
After the chaos settled, the group—now fully mixed—gathered in one of the rooms, sharing snacks and chatting about the day.
The pranks had been exchanged, the laughter had died down, and now… it was just comfortable.
Ai leaned against Shinchan’s shoulder, exhausted. “This was a good day.”
Shinchan grinned. “And it’s only just getting started.”
Kazama sighed. “I swear, if you start more trouble, I’m not helping you.”
Akari smirked. “I dunno… I think I like the chaos.”
Nene laughed. “We should do trips like this more often.”
Masao, still shaken from the ghost prank, simply muttered, “Please… no more scary stuff…”
Rika glanced at Bo but quickly looked away, her face heating up again.
And with that, the first night of their Kyoto trip came to a close.
…Well, after Shinchan tried to pull one last prank and got hit over the head with a pillow by Kazama.
To be continued…

ChatGPT said:
Got it! I'll write this scene with plenty of reactions from everyone, making it fun, awkward, and full of underlying tensions. Here’s how it plays out:

Chapter 121 – A Paired-Up Adventure
The morning started bright and early, the group gathering in the lobby of their inn. The plan for the day? Exploring Kyoto in pairs.
“Alright, listen up!” Akari clapped her hands together, getting everyone’s attention. “We’ve got a lot of places to see today, so instead of walking around like a big, chaotic group, let’s split up into pairs.”
Shinchan raised an eyebrow. “Why pairs?”
Akari grinned. “Because it’ll be fun. And I wanna spend time with Minami alone.”
Minami, standing beside her, sighed. “You didn’t have to say that out loud.”
Akari only winked.
The others exchanged glances. Some were indifferent, some were immediately flustered, and a certain someone (Rika) nearly choked on air.
“Alright, let’s get this over with.” Kazama adjusted his bag, trying to act neutral.
Akari, however, wasn’t done yet. She smiled mischievously. “We’ll decide the pairs randomly.”
The group immediately protested.
“Randomly?!” Masao gulped.
“Like hell I’m trusting your randomness,” Nene crossed her arms.
“Hmm~ Then let’s draw lots,” Akari suggested.
Shinchan grinned. “Or we could do it Shinchan-style—fistfight for your partner.”
Kazama sighed. “No.”
Still, Akari and Minami prepared some folded papers, each containing a number. “Alright, pick one! The person with the same number as you will be your partner.”

The Pairings Are Decided
One by one, everyone picked a paper and opened it. Then, reactions followed immediately.
Ai looked at hers and then turned to Shinchan.
Shinchan unfolded his paper and blinked. “Oh.”
Ai’s face turned red.
Shinchan smirked. “So, we’re together, huh?”
Ai quickly looked away, trying to act cool. “D-Don’t get any weird ideas! It’s just sightseeing!”
Nene, standing beside Masao, let out a long sigh. “Again?”
Masao, already sweating, chuckled nervously. “W-Well, uh… third time’s the charm?”
Nene narrowed her eyes. “You better not mess up like last time.”
Bo, as usual, was unreadable. He glanced at his partner—Rika.
Rika, meanwhile, was trying to play it cool but failed miserably. “I-I see. It’s just random chance.”
Bo gave her a slow nod. “Mhm.”
Rika’s mind was already spiraling. (No. No, no, no. Not alone with Bo! This is too soon! But also… maybe it’s fate?!)
Kazama unfolded his paper. Blank.
“…Wait. There’s no number on mine.”
Akari grinned. “Oh. Looks like there was an odd number of people.”
Kazama’s eye twitched. “You rigged this.”
Minami, the only other one not picking a number, simply adjusted his glasses. “Well, I was always going to be with Akari, so…”
Kazama’s face darkened. “…I see.”
“Anyway, let’s move out!” Akari announced.
Kazama sighed, stuffing his hands in his pockets. As the pairs began walking away, he muttered, “I hate all of you.”
Shinchan, walking with Ai, patted his back. “Don’t worry, buddy. You can be your own date.”
Kazama glared. “I will kill you.”
And so, the group split up, each pair heading into Kyoto for their own unique experience…
To be continued…

kazama, hayashi and yasuo continued in their own direction. now next chapter focus only on masao and nene.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! This chapter will focus entirely on Masao and Nene, giving them meaningful development while keeping their usual dynamic intact. Expect some comedy, misunderstandings, and a bit of genuine heart-to-heart moments.

Chapter 122 – Masao and Nene’s Kyoto Adventure
Masao gulped as he adjusted the strap of his bag, walking alongside Nene through the bustling streets of Kyoto.
Of all the people he could’ve been paired with… why her?
Not that he minded, of course! But every time they were together, something embarrassing always happened.
Meanwhile, Nene was walking ahead, arms crossed, scanning the nearby souvenir shops. She didn’t look too concerned about their pairing, but Masao could feel the weight of her expectations.
"Alright, Masao, listen up."
"H-Huh?"
"You’re in charge of picking where we go first," she declared.
Masao nearly tripped over his own feet. "M-Me?! But you always—!"
"Yeah, yeah, but we’re in Kyoto, and if I leave it to you, I wanna see if you can actually plan something decent for once."
Masao’s brain started working in overdrive. (Okay, okay, think! Where would Nene wanna go?! If I mess this up, she’s just gonna call me useless again!)
"U-Uh… how about we start with… a temple?" he blurted out.
Nene raised an eyebrow. "A temple?"
"Yeah! It’s, uh, traditional! And… cultural!"
She sighed. "Fine. Let’s go."

At the Temple
The two arrived at Kiyomizu-dera, one of Kyoto’s most famous temples, with its towering wooden stage overlooking the vibrant greenery. Tourists and students filled the area, taking photos and enjoying the view.
Masao smiled awkwardly. "So… what do you think?"
Nene looked around, seemingly unimpressed at first. But after a moment, she hummed. "…Not bad."
Masao felt a small wave of relief. He passed the first test!
They walked along the temple grounds, stopping at one of the smaller shrines where couples and hopeful romantics prayed for luck in love. Nene smirked.
"Heh, maybe you should pray here, Masao."
"W-Why me?!"
"Well, you’re always unlucky in love. Who knows? Maybe the gods will finally take pity on you."
Masao pouted. "T-That’s mean, Nene-chan."
She chuckled. "I’m just saying, it wouldn’t hurt to try."
Masao hesitated, then nervously approached the shrine, clapped his hands together, and made a wish. (Please, let today go well… and let Nene not tease me too much…)
Nene, watching him, suddenly felt a strange pang in her chest. She wasn’t sure why, but seeing Masao genuinely wish for something made her feel a little… weird.

Lunch Break Mishap
After the temple visit, the two stopped by a small traditional restaurant to grab some lunch.
"This place looks good," Nene said, leading the way inside.
Masao followed, nervous. He didn’t want to mess up anything, especially with how smooth things were going so far.
They found a small booth and sat across from each other. Masao hesitated, then asked, "Uh, what do you want to eat?"
Nene flipped through the menu, then looked up with a smirk. "You’re paying, right?"
Masao’s soul left his body.
"W-Wait, when did we decide that?!"
"You were the one who said you wanted to plan the trip," she shrugged.
"I-I never said that included paying for lunch!"
Nene crossed her arms, tilting her head. "So, you don’t wanna pay for your childhood friend?"
Masao gulped. He knew this was a trap. He had two choices:
Pay and suffer the financial consequences.


Say no and face the wrath of Nene.


Masao sighed in defeat. "…Fine."
Nene smirked. "Good answer."
The food arrived, and as they ate, the conversation flowed more naturally. They talked about school, their friends, and how weird it was traveling without Shinchan causing chaos.
But then… disaster struck.
Masao, in his eagerness to grab a piece of fried tofu, accidentally knocked over his glass of water—spilling it all over Nene’s skirt.
For a moment, the world froze.
Nene stared at him.
Masao stared back in horror.
Then—
"MASAO, YOU IDIOT!"
"I-I’M SORRY!"
The restaurant fell silent as everyone turned to look at them. Masao scrambled to grab napkins, frantically dabbing at Nene’s skirt.
"STOP TOUCHING ME, YOU PERVERT!"
"I’M JUST TRYING TO HELP!"
The waitress approached, awkwardly smiling. "U-Um, we have towels if you need them…"
Nene snatched one from her, grumbling under her breath as she tried to dry herself off. Masao, meanwhile, was dying inside.
(I WAS DOING SO WELL! WHY AM I LIKE THIS?!)

After Lunch – A Small Moment
Once they left the restaurant, Masao walked beside Nene, still looking guilty.
"…I really am sorry, Nene-chan."
She sighed. "I know."
Masao flinched, but then—Nene lightly flicked his forehead.
"H-Huh?"
"You’re hopeless," she said, rolling her eyes. But she didn’t sound angry anymore. "But at least the day wasn’t completely ruined."
Masao blinked. "R-Really?"
Nene looked away, crossing her arms. "Yeah, yeah. Don’t get used to it."
Masao, despite everything, couldn’t help but smile.
Maybe today wasn’t so bad after all.

Got it! This chapter will focus on Rika and Bo, giving more depth to Rika’s growing feelings and Bo’s usual calm but unexpectedly cool moments. Expect some awkwardness, misunderstandings, and subtle moments of realization.

Chapter 123 – Rika and Bo’s Unexpected Date(?)
The streets of Kyoto were filled with the hum of conversation, the clatter of rickshaws rolling over stone pathways, and the soft rustle of trees swaying in the evening breeze.
Among the many students wandering the historic city, Rika walked stiffly beside Bo, glancing at him every few seconds.
(Okay, Rika, calm down. It’s just a normal walk with Bo… But why does this feel like a date?!)
Ever since that moment—when Bo had caught her as she almost fell the other day—her brain had been acting weird. Normally, she’d think of Bo as just another member of the group, but now?
Now, every time she looked at him, it was like she could hear imaginary shoujo sparkles in the background.
Meanwhile, Bo remained the same as ever. Silent. Calm. Seemingly unaffected by anything.
Which somehow made things even worse for Rika.
"Where do you wanna go first?" she asked, trying to sound casual.
Bo took a slow bite of the taiyaki he had bought earlier. "...Dunno."
Rika twitched. (Come on, give me something to work with!)
"Ugh, you’re impossible," she huffed, crossing her arms. "Fine, let’s just walk around until we find something."
Bo simply nodded and followed her lead.

First Stop – The Fox Shrine
They eventually arrived at Fushimi Inari Taisha, the famous shrine with thousands of red torii gates winding up the mountain.
"Woah… This place is way cooler than I thought," Rika muttered, looking up at the endless pathway of gates.
Bo nodded. "…Yeah."
Rika turned to him. "Wait, you’ve never been here before?"
Bo shook his head. "Nope."
She smirked. "Then this is kinda like a first-time date spot, huh?"
Bo blinked at her. "…A date?"
Rika immediately panicked. "I-I MEAN, NOT LIKE THAT—I JUST MEANT—WELL, YOU KNOW—UGH, NEVER MIND!"
Bo just stared at her for a second, then casually took another bite of his taiyaki.
Rika groaned and dragged him along before she embarrassed herself even more.
As they walked through the shrine, they came across a small side area where people were tying their fortunes onto wooden racks.
"Hey, let’s draw omikuji," Rika said, pointing at the fortune slips. "Bet I get better luck than you."
Bo silently took a slip, and Rika did the same.
She unfolded hers and read: Great Fortune.
"Hah! Look at this! I got daikichi! I’m gonna have amazing luck!" she boasted.
Bo showed her his.
Great Fortune.
Rika twitched. "...Oh, come on."
Bo blinked. "Guess we're the same."
Rika pouted, crossing her arms. "Tch. Whatever."
But for some reason, seeing that they got the same result made her feel… oddly happy.

An Unexpected Moment
As they left the shrine and wandered into a quieter street, Rika sighed in contentment.
"This place is seriously pretty at night," she muttered.
Bo nodded.
A comfortable silence settled between them. But then—
"Aahhh!"
A loud scream echoed from a nearby alley.
Rika immediately turned, eyes wide. "What was that?!"
She saw a little kid, no older than six, sitting on the ground with tears in his eyes. He had scraped his knee, and his parents were nowhere in sight.
Before she could react, Bo was already walking toward the boy.
He crouched down in front of him and, without a word, pulled out a small bandage from his pocket.
Rika watched in surprise as Bo gently placed the bandage over the kid’s scrape.
"There," Bo said simply.
The boy sniffled. "T-Thank you, mister…"
Bo patted his head. "Be careful next time."
A few seconds later, the boy’s parents arrived, frantically thanking Bo before leading their son away.
Rika, meanwhile, was staring.
"You…"
Bo turned to her. "What?"
"You just casually carry around bandages?!"
Bo shrugged. "…Yeah."
"Why?!"
"Because Masao trips a lot."
Rika opened her mouth, then closed it. "...You know what? Fair point."
Still, the scene stuck in her mind. The way Bo had just calmly helped that kid, no hesitation, no fuss…
Her heart did a weird little thump.
(Oh no… I’m falling harder, aren’t I?)

The Way Back
After some more wandering, the two finally made their way back to the inn.
"That was fun," Rika admitted, stretching her arms. "Didn’t think you’d be so cool, though."
Bo blinked. "…Cool?"
Rika immediately regretted saying that out loud. "I-I mean, you know, with the kid thing! Don’t get the wrong idea, idiot!"
Bo just nodded like it wasn’t a big deal.
Rika groaned. (How is he so dense?!)
As they reached the inn entrance, Rika glanced at him, her face slightly red.
"...Hey, Bo."
Bo looked at her. "Hm?"
She hesitated for a second, then muttered, "Today was… kinda nice."
Bo tilted his head. "...Okay."
Rika twitched. "THAT’S IT?!"
Bo blinked. "...Yeah?"
Rika sighed, giving up. "Never mind, you blockhead. I’m going to bed."
She stormed off, leaving Bo standing there, confused.
He stared after her for a moment, then took another bite of his taiyaki.
"...Huh."
For some reason, he felt kind of warm inside.

now fianlly ai and shin. there is progress.

Chapter 124 – A Step Closer
The cool night air wrapped around them as Shin and Ai walked down the dimly lit streets of Kyoto, the lanterns casting soft golden glows on the pavement. Unlike the others who had scattered off in pairs, the two of them had been left together—completely unplanned.
Or so Shin thought.
Ai, on the other hand, had long suspected someone (Akari, I’m looking at you) had set this up. Not that she minded. If anything, she had been waiting for a moment like this.
For too long, it had felt like she was the only one trying to close the distance between them. Teasing him, getting angry at him, even moments of undeniable tension—none of it seemed to make Shin see her the way she saw him.
But tonight, things felt different.
And she wasn’t going to waste this chance.

The Walk
"So, where are we going?" Shin asked, shoving his hands into his pockets.
"Who knows?" Ai hummed. "I’m just following where my feet take me."
"That’s dumb."
She flicked his forehead. "You’re dumb."
Shin smirked, rubbing his forehead. "You’ve been hanging out with Nene too much."
"Or maybe you just say a lot of dumb things," Ai shot back, then paused. "Though… I guess it’s a little nice, just walking like this."
Shin didn’t respond immediately, but she caught the way his smirk softened.
"Yeah," he muttered, eyes on the path ahead.
It was moments like these—when Shin wasn’t playing around, when his usual lazy expression faded into something real—that Ai felt herself falling harder.
(Get a grip, Ai. You can’t just keep falling for a guy who doesn’t even realize he’s making you fall.)
She glanced at him. "Hey, Shin…"
"Hm?"
"...Why did you agree to be the student council president?"
Shin blinked. "Huh? What kinda random question is that?"
"It’s not random," Ai shrugged. "I was just thinking about it. You don’t act like someone who’d want the position. It’s a lot of work, and you’re—"
"Lazy?"
"Well, yeah," Ai said bluntly.
Shin chuckled. "Can’t argue with that."
"So? Why?"
He was quiet for a moment, then looked up at the sky.
"...Dunno," he admitted. "I guess… when I saw the elections happening, I just kinda thought, ‘Eh, why not?’"
Ai rolled her eyes. "That’s such a you reason."
"But," Shin added, "I guess it’s not that bad. It’s kinda fun, y’know? The chaos, the weird situations, the people." He glanced at her. "And I guess if I wasn’t president, I wouldn’t be spending so much time with you."
Ai almost tripped.
(WAIT—DID HE JUST—WAS THAT A—?!)
She stared at him, her heart suddenly pounding. "…What?"
Shin tilted his head. "What?"
"You—" Ai clenched her fists. "You can’t just say things like that so casually!"
Shin raised an eyebrow. "Huh? What did I say?"
Ai groaned. "Forget it." (He’s so hopeless. But also—why did that make my heart do weird things?!)

The Temple at Night
They eventually found themselves at a small temple on the outskirts of town, nearly deserted at this hour. The only light came from the few lanterns lining the stone steps.
Ai climbed the steps first, turning back when she noticed Shin still at the bottom. "What, getting lazy already?"
Shin sighed. "What’s the point of going up?"
Ai gave him a look. "You came all the way here and you’re not even gonna make a wish?"
Shin scoffed. "Wishes are just lazy ways of wanting stuff without doing anything for it."
Ai rolled her eyes. "Spoken like a guy who probably never wished for anything seriously."
Shin yawned. "Because I haven’t."
Ai paused.
"...Not even once?"
He glanced at her, then away. "...Not really."
She frowned. "That’s kinda sad."
Shin shrugged. "Not really."
For a while, they stood there in silence. The night breeze was cool, rustling the trees, filling the air with the quiet sound of leaves whispering against each other.
Ai looked at the shrine, then at Shin. Then, before she could second-guess herself—
She reached out and took his hand.
Shin stiffened. "Oi."
"Shut up," Ai said, pulling him up the steps.
He could’ve resisted—should’ve, even—but for some reason, he didn’t.
And just like that, they were standing in front of the shrine together.
"Make a wish," Ai said.
Shin sighed. "We’ve been over this—"
"Just do it," Ai cut him off.
Shin looked at her for a second, then at the shrine. With an exaggerated sigh, he clapped his hands together. Ai did the same.
They both closed their eyes.
Ai’s wish was simple: I wish for Shin to finally realize what’s in front of him.
When she opened her eyes, she turned to Shin. "...So? What did you wish for?"
Shin stretched. "I wished for ramen."
Ai smacked his arm. "Be serious, idiot!"
Shin laughed. "Fine, fine."
Ai watched him closely. "…Well?"
Shin hesitated, then muttered, "I just wished… for things to stay like this for a little longer."
Ai’s breath caught.
It wasn’t a confession.
It wasn’t anything outright romantic.
But for Shin—the guy who never really cared, never really put effort into things, never really wished for anything—
It was progress.
And for now, that was enough.

The Walk Back
As they walked back to the inn, Ai felt lighter than before.
Shin walked beside her, hands in his pockets, gaze on the road ahead. But something felt different.
Or maybe it was just Ai’s heart, still beating a little too fast.
After a while, Shin spoke.
"...Oi."
Ai blinked. "What?"
Shin scratched his cheek. "You’re still holding my hand."
Ai froze.
Then, in an instant, she let go. "I-I knew that! I was just—!"
Shin smirked. "Yeah, yeah."
Ai huffed. "Ugh, you’re impossible."
But even as she grumbled, she couldn’t wipe the smile off her face.
And neither, for the first time, could Shin.

the last day the grp explored again, but this time buying suveniors. till night when adrenaline and excitment and fun was at an all time high.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 125 – The Final Night of the Trip
The sun hung low over Kyoto as the group wandered through the streets, weaving through the crowds of tourists and locals. Their school trip was nearing its end, and while the past few days had been filled with sightseeing, laughter, and unexpected moments, there was one thing left to do—buy souvenirs.
At least, that was the official reason.
In reality, no one was quite ready to go home just yet.
The energy in the air was different. There was a sense of urgency—one last chance to make memories before they boarded the train back.

The Shopping Chaos
"You have to get something for Hima," Ai reminded Shin, her hands on her hips as they stood outside a small shop.
Shin yawned. "Why? She didn't even come."
"Exactly. She'll throw a fit if you come back empty-handed."
Shin sighed, dragging his feet into the store. Ai followed behind him, shaking her head.
Meanwhile, a few shops down—
"Bo, what do you think?" Rika held up two different hair accessories. One was a simple but elegant sakura-patterned clip, the other a more extravagant golden one.
Bo blinked. "For you?"
"Obviously."
Bo tilted his head. "The first one suits you more."
Rika stared at him. (Wait… does he mean that? He noticed what would look good on me?!) Her face heated up. "O-Oh… yeah, okay, I’ll get this one."
Bo, oblivious as ever, simply nodded.
Not far away, Masao was running for his life.
"MASAO! YOU BETTER GET ME SOMETHING GOOD!"
Nene was storming after him, the poor boy clutching his wallet in sheer panic. "I WAS ALREADY PLANNING TO, STOP CHASING ME!"
Kazama, Hayashi, and Yasuo watched them sprint past, sipping their drinks like it was just another Tuesday.
"Should we help?" Hayashi asked.
"Nah, he needs the cardio," Kazama said flatly.

An Unforgettable Night
By the time everyone had bought their souvenirs, the night had fully settled in. Kyoto glowed under the warm lantern lights, and the group wasn’t ready to head back just yet.
"I say we go somewhere for one last hurrah," Yasuo suggested.
"Like where?" Nene asked.
"The riverside?" Minami proposed.
"Too quiet," Akari dismissed.
"An arcade?" Hayashi offered.
"A karaoke place?" Kazama added.
Then, to everyone's surprise—
"...What about the shrine again?"
All heads turned to Shin.
"The one we visited the other night?" Ai blinked.
Shin shrugged. "It was kinda nice."
There was a brief silence.
Then—
"I agree." Bo nodded.
"Yeah, sounds fun," Masao added.
With that, the plan was set.

The Shrine Visit – A Different Atmosphere
Unlike their last visit, this time the entire group stood before the shrine. The atmosphere was electric—buzzing with leftover adrenaline from their trip, the unspoken sadness that it was ending, and the excitement of the moment.
"Alright," Yasuo grinned. "We all make one last wish before we leave Kyoto."
There were murmurs of agreement.
One by one, they stepped up.
Kazama wished for fewer student council headaches.
Masao wished for less Nene-induced suffering.
Nene wished for more Masao-induced suffering.
Rika wished for good grades.
Bo? …He just clapped his hands, not making a wish at all.
Ai glanced at Shin, who stood beside her.
"You better wish for something real this time," she teased.
Shin smirked. "What, is wishing for ramen not real?"
Ai rolled her eyes.
Then, as she watched him close his eyes—this time taking a little longer than before—she found herself staring.
(What did you wish for this time, Shin?)
She wanted to ask.
But for now, she let the moment be.
Because whatever it was—she had a feeling, deep down, that he wouldn’t be as indifferent as he used to be.
And that was enough.

The Walk Back – The Peak of the Trip
The shrine visit left everyone feeling nostalgic, but as they walked back toward their inn, that nostalgia quickly turned into absolute chaos.
Because someone (probably Yasuo) had the brilliant idea to start a race.
And suddenly, the streets of Kyoto became a battlefield.
"I’M NOT LOSING TO YOU, KAZAMA!" Shin yelled.
"WHY ARE YOU EVEN COMPETING?! IT WASN’T EVEN A REAL RACE!"
"THAT’S LOSER TALK!"
Masao and Nene were pushing each other mid-run.
Bo? Winning effortlessly without even trying.
Minami and Akari were hand in hand, casually walking behind the chaos.
By the time they reached the inn, everyone was out of breath.
And laughing.
And happy.
It was the perfect way to end the trip.

The Final Night – A Moment of Reflection
Back in their rooms, the boys collapsed on the futons, still breathless.
"That was stupid," Kazama muttered.
"That was amazing," Yasuo grinned.
Shin lay on his back, staring at the ceiling. "We should do this kinda thing more often."
There was a quiet murmur of agreement.
On the girls’ side, Ai sat by the window, looking out at the Kyoto skyline.
"You look deep in thought," Rika said, sitting beside her.
Ai smiled slightly. "Just… thinking about how fun this trip was."
Rika nudged her. "And about Shin too, huh?"
Ai’s face turned red. "S-Shut up."
Rika laughed. "It’s okay, Ai-chan. You’re getting there."
Ai didn’t respond, but she didn’t deny it either.
Because for the first time in a long time… she felt like she actually was.
And maybe—just maybe—this was only the beginning.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 126 – Back to Reality, But Not Just Yet
The train ride home was much quieter than when they had first boarded it.
Not in an awkward way—just the kind of silence that comes after days of nonstop energy, excitement, and absolute chaos. Some students dozed off, others scrolled through their phones, reviewing photos and videos they had taken.
Shin was slouched in his seat, arms crossed, his head leaning slightly to the side. Ai, seated next to him, tried not to stare. (He actually looks peaceful for once…)
Kazama, a few seats away, was attempting to finish a book, but his eyes kept drooping. Meanwhile, Masao and Nene were bickering again, while Bo was just quietly looking out the window, deep in thought.
Rika, across from Ai, smirked. “Gonna take a picture?” she teased in a low voice.
Ai turned red. “I-I wasn’t—shut up!”
Rika giggled, leaning back in her seat.
The train rumbled on, slowly bringing their trip to an end.

Arrival Home – Shin’s Return to Family Life
By the time they stepped off the train and walked through the familiar streets of their hometown, reality finally settled in.
It was the weekend afternoon, the sun warm but not too harsh. As Shin approached his house, luggage in tow, he stretched.
“Finally home…” he muttered.
But the moment he opened the door—
“SHIN-CHAN!”
“ONI-CHAN!”
Before he could react, Hiroshi, Misae, and Hima tackled him.
“Oof—?! W-What the—?!”
“You’re late!” Hima pouted, arms crossed. “We expected you back earlier!”
“You should’ve called!” Misae added. “I was about to send a search party!”
Hiroshi just grinned. “Welcome back, son.”
Shin sighed, exhausted. “I was on time. You guys are just impatient.”
Misae ignored him and started inspecting him like a detective.
“You better not have gotten into trouble.”
“I always get into trouble.”
Hima gasped dramatically. “So you admit it!”
“Shut up, mini-me.”
Despite all their noise, there was warmth in the chaos. It wasn’t that Shin missed them—he wouldn’t admit that—but it was nice to be back.
Then, he reached into his bag. “Here,” he said, pulling out a few souvenirs.
Hima’s eyes lit up.
“You actually got me something?!”
“Yeah, yeah, don’t make it a big deal.”
Hima snatched the bag from him, giggling. “He totally missed me.”
Misae looked at her gift and smiled. “Oh, this is nice.”
Hiroshi gave Shin a thumbs-up. “Good job, son.”
Shin smirked. “See? I am a good kid.”
Misae and Hima gave him a look.
“Let’s not go that far.”

Evening Ramen – The Grand Reunion
By the time the sun was setting, the main group had already made plans—and of course, it involved food.
Shin, Kazama, Ai, Nene, Masao, Bo, Rika, Minami, Akari, Hayashi, and Yasuo all squeezed into their usual ramen shop, cramming into the largest table available.
The atmosphere was lively.
“So? What was the best part of the trip?” Hayashi asked, slurping his noodles.
“Definitely the race,” Yasuo said.
“No way,” Masao argued. “The best part was when Shin and Ai—”
Ai kicked him under the table.
Masao yelped.
“What was that?” Bo asked.
“Nothing.” Ai smiled sweetly, sipping her tea.
Kazama sighed. “I’m just glad we survived.”
“Speak for yourself,” Shin smirked. “I had fun.”
Ai, Rika, and Nene all stared at him.
“…You had fun?”
Shin shrugged. “Yeah. I mean, it was chaos, but… our kind of chaos.”
Everyone was quiet for a second.
Then—
“That’s the most sincere thing he’s said all week.”
“Someone record this moment.”
“Shin-chan actually expressing emotions? Impossible.”
Shin groaned, slouching in his seat. “Forget it, I take it back.”
The laughter continued, the teasing never stopped, and for one night—before school started again—they simply enjoyed being together.
Because even though the trip was over…
The real fun never really ended.

after the weekend on monday the school kept a surprised test about kyoto.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 127 – The Unexpected Test
Monday morning.
The weekend had passed in a blink, and just like that, they were back in class. Most of them were still mentally on vacation mode, and some (read: Shin) had barely unpacked their bags.
But the moment they sat down, Kazama felt a disturbance in the air.
“…Why does the teacher have that evil aura around him?” Kazama muttered.
Masao, still yawning, rubbed his eyes. “Huh?”
Before anyone could react, their homeroom teacher clapped his hands together.
“Alright, students! Since you all recently visited Kyoto, we’re going to have a little surprise test about everything you learned on the trip!”
Silence.
Then—
“EEEEHHHHH?!”
Nene stood up. “Sensei! This wasn’t in the itinerary!”
The teacher smirked. “Neither was half the trouble you caused on the trip.”
“…Fair enough.” She sat back down.
Ai, still groggy from the morning, whispered to Shin. “Did you even listen to any of the tour guides?”
Shin leaned back, arms crossed. “I memorized one fact. That’s enough, right?”
Kazama looked offended. “One? You absolute menace.”
Meanwhile, Bo simply nodded. “This will be fine.”
Everyone else: “You say that, but we are NOT convinced.”
The test papers were handed out, and panic settled in.

The Exam Hall of Doom
Kazama was in his element.
His eyes glowed with determination, his pencil moved at lightning speed, and he looked like a man possessed by knowledge.
Meanwhile—
Masao was sweating bullets. His pencil hovered over the paper as he muttered, “Was the temple we visited Kinkaku-ji or Ginkaku-ji…?”
Nene wasn’t much better. “Maybe if I write both, I can gaslight the teacher into giving me points…”
Ai, usually calm, was frowning. “I should’ve taken more notes instead of only taking photos.”
Rika sighed. “At least we can make educated guesses.”
Then there was Shin.
Slouching in his seat.
Looking bored.
Staring at a completely blank paper.
Ai glanced over and whispered angrily. “At least write something!”
Shin sighed dramatically, finally picking up his pencil. “Fine.”
Then, with complete confidence, he wrote his one memorized fact.
"Kyoto has many temples."
Ai nearly flipped her desk.

The Aftermath
When the test ended, the room exploded into chaos.
“THAT WAS EVIL.”
“I guessed half my answers.”
“I think I passed, but I feel betrayed.”
Kazama, looking satisfied, adjusted his tie. “That was easy.”
Shin yawned. “Yeah, yeah, nerd.”
Ai grabbed Shin’s paper. “Wait. What did you even—”
She stopped.
She stared at his one sentence.
Then, without hesitation—
She slapped the back of his head.
“Are you kidding me?!”
Shin just grinned. “I said I memorized one fact.”
“You absolute moron.”
The rest of the day continued with everyone ranting about the test, and Shin, as usual, somehow surviving despite his absolute nonsense.
Because of course he did.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 128 – The Fire of Jealousy
The evening was cool, a rare break from the usual heat of the season. Ai was on her way back from a convenience store, humming lightly as she walked down the road near the train station.
And then—
She froze.
Across the street, Shin was walking with a girl clinging onto him.
Her arms wrapped around his, her body pressed close, and she was smiling—no, giggling.
Ai's grip on her plastic bag tightened.
“…What. The. Hell.”

The Scene of the Crime
Ai stared in disbelief.
Shin wasn't resisting.
In fact—
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS CASUALLY ACCEPTING IT.
The girl, with short hair and a sweet face, kept talking and laughing while leaning onto him. Shin, with his usual annoying nonchalance, just walked along like this was the most normal thing in the world.
Ai felt something dangerous bubble inside her chest.
And then—
Shin lowered his head slightly and said something to the girl.
She smiled up at him.
Ai turned around and walked away.
Her face burning.
Her mind spinning.
Her chest aching.

The Emotional Spiral
By the time Ai got home, she had replayed the scene a thousand times.
Who was that girl?!


Why was she clinging to him?!


Why didn't he push her away?!


Did Shin actually… like her?!


Ai threw her pillow against the wall.
“This IDIOT!”
She wasn't stupid—she knew that Shin had zero interest in romance (at least, openly), but that was exactly what made it worse.
Because if he didn’t care, then why the hell was he fine with some random girl being all over him?!
She pouted. Hard.
Then, before she even realized it—
She grabbed her phone.
And typed.
Ai: Where are you?
No response.
She gritted her teeth.
“…Fine. Let’s see how you handle this.”

The Other Side of the Story
Meanwhile, across town—
“Damn, you're heavy.”
“Shut up,” Hima muttered, leaning against Shin’s side.
“Don’t complain,” Hima’s friend, Miku, huffed. “I’m leaning on him too.”
Shin sighed. “I swear, how the hell do both of you manage to trip down the same staircase?”
“We slipped,” Hima grumbled.
“…At the same time?”
“…Yes.”
Shin rolled his eyes. He had just finished helping them at the clinic and was dragging both of them back home because—
"I don't trust you morons not to fall again."
Hima, despite her sore ankle, kicked his leg lightly.
Miku pouted. “But hey, at least we have a nice, reliable guy to help us~.”
Shin ignored her completely.
He had no idea that this little scene was about to bite him in the ass.

The Slow Burn of Disaster
The next day, Ai was ice cold.
Shin noticed immediately.
At lunch—she didn’t sit next to him.
 During Student Council work—she barely spoke.
 On the walk home—she ignored him.
Shin, being Shin, figured out something was up… but was too lazy to guess what.
Until—
“Hey, Ai.”
She didn’t even glance at him.
His eyebrow twitched.
“Oi.” He poked her shoulder.
No reaction.
“…Ai?”
Still nothing.
Oh.
Oh, so she was actually mad.
Shin leaned back in his chair, staring at her for a second.
Then, slowly, his lips curved into a smirk.
“Did I do something?”
Ai snapped.
She turned sharply, glaring.
“Oh? So you don’t know?”
Shin blinked. “…No?”
She crossed her arms. “Interesting.”
Shin’s brain: ERROR.
This… was bad.
Because Ai was the petty type.
The type to never tell you why she was mad until she had made you suffer first.
And suffer he did.
For days.

The "Resolution" (or So He Thought)
Finally, after way too long, Ai cracked.
“…So who was she?”
Shin blinked. “Who?”
Ai looked like she wanted to murder him.
“The girl clinging to you the other night.”
Shin, after a solid five seconds, finally remembered.
“…Oh. That was Hima’s friend.”
Ai froze.
“…What?”
Shin sighed. “They both fell and sprained their legs. I had to help them.”
Ai stared.
Then—
“…Wait.”
She narrowed her eyes.
“…Then why didn’t I see Hima?”
Shin tilted his head. “Maybe because Miku was in the way?”
“…Miku?”
“Hima’s friend. The one clinging to me.”
Ai’s eye twitched.
…
…So she just didn’t see Hima.
So she had suffered for days.
So she had ignored him like an idiot.
Over nothing.
Ai felt her entire soul leave her body.
“…I hate you,” she muttered.
Shin grinned. “Feeling dumb yet?”
Ai grabbed the nearest pillow and threw it at his face.
“Shut up!”
But—
If one looked closely—
They’d see her ears turning red.

Chapter 129 – Christmas is Here!
Winter had fully settled in, wrapping the town in a soft, chilly embrace. The streets sparkled with festive lights, shops played cheerful jingles, and the scent of roasted chestnuts and hot chocolate filled the air.
And at Kasukabe High School, Christmas fever had officially begun.
Shin yawned as he walked through the school gates, hands deep in his pockets. The moment he stepped inside, he was greeted with chaos.
Banners. Snowflake decorations. A giant Christmas tree standing proudly in the main hallway. Students were buzzing about the upcoming Christmas Eve party, which was apparently a big deal this year.
Kazama walked up beside him, adjusting his scarf. "The Student Council really went all out this time, huh?"
Shin glanced around lazily. "Did we? I don’t remember working that hard."
Kazama shot him a deadpan look. "That’s because Ai did everything. You just stood there and approved stuff."
"Ahh, sounds about right."
Kazama sighed, shaking his head. "So, got any plans for Christmas?"
Shin shrugged. "Nope."
"Not even with Ai?"
Shin blinked. "Hah?"
Kazama smirked. "You two have been… closer lately. Just thought you’d be doing something together."
Shin groaned. "Not you too."
Kazama laughed. "Well, better figure it out soon. I heard the girls were talking about a plan last night."
Shin narrowed his eyes. "What plan?"
Kazama just grinned. "You'll find out soon enough."
And that did not sit well with him.

Christmas Plans in Motion
Meanwhile, the girls had already decided.
At lunch, Ai, Nene, and Rika sat together, whispering excitedly.
"So, we’re definitely spending Christmas together, right?" Nene asked, sipping her hot tea.
"Obviously," Ai said, crossing her arms. "We just need to drag the boys into it too."
Rika smirked. "Shouldn’t be hard. Masao will follow if Nene tells him to, Bo doesn’t really say no, and Kazama’s already curious. Shin’s the only wildcard."
Ai sighed, rubbing her temples. "Yeah… that idiot probably hasn’t even thought about Christmas."
Nene giggled. "Well, that’s why we make him think about it."
Rika leaned forward. "So? What’s the plan?"
Ai’s eyes twinkled mischievously.
"We're renting a cabin in the mountains."
The other two froze.
"Wait… what?"
Ai grinned. "It's perfect. Snow, hot springs, Christmas lights, the whole package. I already booked it."
Nene’s jaw dropped. "You already—?! Ai, that's so bold!"
Rika snickered. "And I bet you made sure that you and Shin were in the same room?"
Ai choked on her drink. "W-WHAT?! NO! I didn't—!"
Rika smirked harder. "Ohhh, suspicious."
Ai covered her face. "Shut up!"
Nene giggled. "Well, whatever. We just need to tell them."
Rika grinned. "Or we just kidnap them and not tell them until we're already there."
Ai's eyes shone with mischief.
"...I like the way you think."

The Boys Get Dragged In
After school, the girls ambushed the boys.
"We’re spending Christmas together," Ai announced, arms crossed.
Masao blinked. "Oh, we are?"
"Yes," Nene said. "We rented a cabin. You’re coming."
Bo nodded. "Sounds fun."
Kazama raised an eyebrow. "Wait, I never agreed—"
"You have no choice," Ai interrupted.
Kazama sighed. "Figured."
Then all eyes turned to Shin.
He stared at them for a moment.
"...Do I get a say in this?"
"No," Ai said flatly.
Shin stared harder. "...Well, okay then."
Rika snorted. "You gave up way too fast."
Shin stretched. "It's not like I had plans anyway."
Kazama smirked. "You sure? Sounds like Ai planned a romantic getaway."
Ai kicked Kazama’s shin. "SAY THAT AGAIN, I DARE YOU."
Shin grinned. "Now I’m interested."
Ai turned red. "SHUT UP!"

Christmas Eve – The Cabin Trip
The weekend came, and the group boarded the train to the snowy mountains.
The cabin was huge, with a fireplace, soft couches, and huge windows overlooking the snowy landscape.
As soon as they arrived, Masao and Nene immediately started a snowball fight, with Bo joining in.
Kazama and Shin went to check out the onsen, while Ai and Rika set up Christmas decorations inside.
At night, they gathered around the fireplace, drinking hot cocoa and sharing Christmas stories.
Ai, wrapped in a blanket, nudged Shin. "You having fun?"
Shin sipped his drink. "Surprisingly, yeah."
She smirked. "Told you this was a good idea."
Shin glanced at her.
The warm glow of the fireplace reflected in her eyes.
"...Yeah. You did."
Ai’s heart skipped.
She quickly turned away. "I-It’s just Christmas. Don't get any weird ideas."
Shin grinned. "I wasn’t thinking anything weird."
Ai did not believe him.

Christmas Morning – A Special Surprise
The next morning, they exchanged gifts.
Masao got a scarf from Nene.
 Bo got a new sketchbook from Rika.
 Kazama got a book (obviously).
And Ai…
She hesitated as she handed Shin his gift.
"...Here."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "What is it?"
"Just open it."
He did.
Inside was a handmade keychain. A tiny figurine of Shin, wearing a Santa hat, holding a little kendo sword.
Shin stared.
"...Did you make this?"
Ai looked away. "...Yeah."
Shin held it in his palm, running a thumb over the details.
"...It's cool."
Ai blushed. "D-Don't say it like that, idiot!"
Shin chuckled.
"...Thanks."
Ai felt like she was melting.
This Christmas… was perfect.

Chapter 130 – A Full-Family Christmas
Just when everyone thought the Christmas trip was settled, another unexpected guest arrived.
As the group was lounging in the cozy cabin, sipping hot chocolate and enjoying the warm fireplace, the front door suddenly slammed open.
"MERRY CHRISTMAS, LOSERS!"
Everyone turned in shock to see Himawari Nohara standing at the entrance, hands on her hips, grinning smugly.
Shin stared, still holding his cup. "...What the hell?"
Hima strolled in confidently, dragging her suitcase behind her.
Ai blinked. "Hima?! What are you doing here?!"
Hima smirked. "Oh, I just happened to hear that my beloved older brother and his friends were having a Christmas trip without me."
Shin sighed. "We didn’t invite you."
"Exactly!" Hima huffed, stomping over. "So I invited myself!"
Kazama rubbed his temples. "How did you even get here?"
Hima grinned. "Oh, I just told Mom and Dad that you guys were bullying me by leaving me out, and they immediately booked me a ticket."
Shin facepalmed. "They’re so damn gullible."
Masao laughed nervously. "W-Well, it’s not like we mind you being here…"
Nene smiled. "Yeah! It’s more fun with more people!"
Bo simply nodded in agreement.
Ai sighed, placing her hands on her hips. "Fine. But don’t cause trouble, Hima."
Hima grinned wider. "Who, me? Trouble? I’m an angel."
Shin scoffed. "Yeah, an angel sent from hell."
Hima kicked his leg. "Merry Christmas, dear brother."

A Very Chaotic Christmas Eve
Now that Hima had joined the group, the chaos doubled.
It started with the snowball war.
Originally, it was just Masao, Nene, and Bo playing around.
Then Kazama and Rika got involved.
Then Ai joined because she wanted to pelt Shin in the face.
Then Hima jumped in, teaming up with Ai to take down her brother.
And thus, the war was declared:
Boys vs. Girls.
Shin, Kazama, Masao, Bo, and Yasuo vs. Ai, Nene, Rika, Hima, and Akari.
Hayashi and Minami were the neutral judges.
And it was absolute madness.
Snowballs flew like missiles, people dodged and rolled, and the once-pristine snow-covered landscape became a battlefield.
Hima laughed as she nailed Shin right in the face.
"Bullseye!"
Shin spat out snow. "You little—!"
Kazama, wiping snow off his glasses, sighed. "This is getting out of hand."
Masao, already buried in snow, weakly raised a hand. "I think… I lost…"
Bo stood tall, still unfazed, catching a snowball midair with one hand.
Rika, watching from the other side, blushed.
Ai grinned. "Alright, girls! Final attack!"
Shin’s eyes widened. "Retreat!"
But it was too late.
A massive snow avalanche came crashing down on them.
The girls cheered.
The boys suffered.

Christmas Dinner & Gifts Exchange
After warming up by the fireplace and changing into dry clothes, the group sat around the giant Christmas feast.
Hima, sitting next to Kazama, nudged him. "So, did you miss me?"
Kazama, mid-bite, almost choked. "W-What?"
Hima giggled. "Just kidding~"
Ai smirked at Shin. "You better appreciate this meal. We worked hard on it."
Shin grinned. "Oh? Did you cook?"
Ai crossed her arms. "Of course! Nene and I made the side dishes, and Akari and Rika helped with dessert!"
Kazama sipped his tea. "So who actually cooked the main dish?"
Ai paused. "...Hayashi."
Shin burst out laughing. "Yeah, that checks out."
The night continued with gift exchanges.
Kazama gave Hima a charm bracelet. (She totally read too much into it.)
Bo gave Rika a sketch of her in the snow. (She blushed for an hour.)
Masao gave Nene a pair of matching mittens. (She held his hand a little too long.)
Ai gave Shin the handmade keychain.
And Shin…
He scratched his cheek, a little awkward.
"...Here."
Ai blinked as she took the small box.
When she opened it, her eyes widened.
Inside was a silver snowflake pendant.
Ai stared.
"You… bought this?" she asked quietly.
Shin shrugged. "Yeah. I dunno, figured you’d like it."
Ai felt her heart race.
Nene gasped dramatically. "Ai… did you just get a romantic Christmas gift?!"
Ai snapped. "SHUT UP, NENE!"
But her face was bright red.
Shin just smirked.

Christmas Night – The Final Moment
As everyone settled down for the night, Shin walked out onto the cabin’s balcony, staring at the snowy landscape.
Ai joined him a moment later, hands in her pockets.
"...Thanks for the gift," she muttered.
Shin glanced at her. "You really like it?"
Ai clutched the pendant. "...Yeah. A lot."
Shin smirked. "You’re easy to please."
Ai glared. "Do you want me to throw you into the snow?"
Shin laughed.
The cold wind blew gently around them.
Then, suddenly—
A single snowflake landed on Ai’s nose.
Shin stared.
Ai blinked. "Huh?"
Then, before she could react—
Shin flicked her forehead.
Ai yelped. "HEY!"
Shin chuckled. "Merry Christmas, Ai."
Ai, still rubbing her forehead, pouted.
But then, she looked at him.
And smiled softly.
"...Merry Christmas, Shin."
And with that, Christmas came to a perfect close.

Chapter 132 – New Year’s Coincidences
New Year's Eve at Shin’s House
As the final hours of the year ticked away, the entire group had gathered at Shinchan’s house for a New Year’s Eve party.
Hiroshi and Misae, used to chaos, had already prepared plenty of food, and even Hima had her own friends over in another room.
"Alright, alright!" Hiroshi clapped his hands as he set down plates of food. "Eat up, kids! It’s a celebration!"
Misae sighed. "Just don’t trash the place."
Shin grinned. "No promises."
The living room was packed—Kazama, Ai, Nene, Masao, Bo, Rika, Minami, Hayashi, Yasuo, Ren, and Akari all sat around a massive table filled with snacks, drinks, and decorations.
"So," Kazama leaned back, "anyone have a New Year’s resolution?"
Masao rubbed his chin. "Mmm… maybe to get better grades?"
Nene scoffed. "Yeah, right."
Masao pouted. "Hey!"
Bo spoke next, calmly. "To improve my art."
Rika, sitting next to him, blushed slightly but nodded. "That’s a good one..."
Nene smirked. "I resolve to win the next girls vs. boys snowball fight."
"Not happening," Shin smirked.
Ai crossed her arms. "Mine is to beat Shin in a test."
Shin laughed. "Hah! That’s your resolution? Good luck with that."
Ai huffed. "I will! Just wait!"
Kazama sighed. "I suppose I should focus more on my student council duties."
Nene snickered. "More than you already do? That’s impossible."
Hima, from across the room, poked her head in. "My resolution? To annoy Shin more."
Shin threw a pillow at her.
As midnight approached, they all counted down together—
"5… 4… 3… 2… 1… HAPPY NEW YEAR!"
Cheers, laughter, and the sound of soda bottles popping filled the air.
And just like that, a new year began.

New Year's Day – Coincidental Shrine Visit
The next morning, after a long night of celebrations, the group lazily got ready to visit the shrine for hatsumode (the first shrine visit of the year).
As fate would have it—
They all ran into each other.
"Eh?! You guys too?!"
Shin, Kazama, Ai, Nene, Masao, Bo, and the others stood at the shrine entrance, wearing warm traditional clothes.
Misae sighed. "Why am I not surprised?"
Ai blinked. "Wait… is that—?"
Indeed—
The families were here too.
Hiroshi and Misae greeted Kazama’s parents, Ai’s father, Nene’s mother, and even Bo’s relatives.
Masao’s grandparents were also nearby, chatting with Hayashi’s older brother.
Hima, who had tagged along, smirked. "So this is what it's like when the whole town gathers."
Kazama looked away. "This is a little embarrassing..."
Shin laughed. "Damn, now it’s a full reunion."
Misae pushed them forward. "Come on, come on! Make your wishes already!"
As they walked up to the shrine, they all closed their eyes and threw their 5-yen coins into the offering box.
One by one, they made their silent wishes.
Nene clasped her hands. ("Please let Masao confess already.")
Masao, nervously, closed his eyes. ("I just want to be braver this year…")
Bo, calmly, wished. ("More inspiration for my art.")
Rika, blushing, wished. ("More chances with Bo…")
Kazama, taking a deep breath. ("Please let this year be peaceful…")
Ai, determined, whispered. ("Let me beat Shin.")
Shin, smirking, had one simple wish—
("Let this year be interesting.")
As they all opened their eyes, the air was filled with the sounds of distant bells, laughter, and the fresh scent of the new year.
And so—
Another year began.
You said:
a fun filled days at school.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 133 – A Fun-Filled Day at School
The new year energy hadn’t faded yet, and the school was filled with laughter, excitement, and the occasional chaos as students settled back into their routine.
Shin and his group, however, had no plans of keeping things normal.

Morning Shenanigans
"Oi, wake up!"
Shin’s head jerked up from his desk as Kazama slammed a book down in front of him.
"Jeez, Kazama, let me sleep," Shin yawned, stretching. "It’s a new year, let’s start it fresh, y'know, by doing less work?"
Kazama glared. "We have council work after school, don’t slack off!"
Ai, sitting beside them, smirked. "Maybe he’s still dreaming about me."
Shin blinked. "Wait, why you?"
Ai flipped her hair. "You did spend the New Year’s party staring at me, after all."
Kazama sighed. "Here we go again..."
Before Shin could defend himself, the bell rang, and their homeroom teacher entered.
"Alright, everyone, sit down!"
As the lesson started, Nene leaned over to whisper to Masao.
"Psst, you studied for this quiz?"
Masao turned pale. "W-We had a quiz?!"
Bo, as always, was calm. "It was in the syllabus."
Masao looked like he was about to die inside.

Lunch Chaos
The cafeteria was packed, as usual.
"So, who’s buying me lunch?" Shin grinned, hands in pockets.
Nene smirked. "The president of the student council can’t afford lunch?"
Ai leaned in. "Is that an invitation for me to treat you?"
Shin sighed. "Man, I should’ve just stolen Hima’s lunch before leaving home."
Masao, devouring his food, suddenly paused. "H-Hey, did you guys see the limited-edition parfait they’re selling today?"
"Limited edition?" Kazama adjusted his tie. "That means—"
Before he could finish—
BOOM.
A wave of students had already rushed toward the dessert counter.
Kazama's eye twitched. "Never mind."
Meanwhile, Bo was just calmly eating, watching the chaos unfold.
Rika, sitting across from him, found herself blushing again. ("Why does he look so cool while eating?")

Club Activities & More Mischief
After lunch, it was time for clubs.
Shin, Ai, and Rika headed to the Kendo club, where Shin sparred against upperclassmen.
Ai, who was practicing archery, kept glancing at him.
("He looks cool when he’s focused… No! Focus, Ai!")
Meanwhile, Masao and Nene were at the home economics club, where Nene forced Masao to bake cookies with her.
"Y-You sure this is edible?" Masao poked the dough.
"Shut up and mix!" Nene whacked his arm.
Bo, meanwhile, was in the art club, quietly sketching.
Rika, who "coincidentally" passed by, peeked over his shoulder.
"W-What are you drawing?"
Bo tilted his head. "A cat."
Rika blushed. ("Even his art is cool…!")

End of the Day – Council Chaos
As the school day ended, the student council gathered for work.
Shin, Ai, Kazama, Nene, and a few others were buried in papers.
"This is too much work for a new year," Shin groaned.
Ai leaned in, smirking. "You can always quit. Then I’ll take over~"
Shin glared. "Not happening."
Kazama sighed, already signing off documents. "Can you two stop flirting for five minutes?"
"WHO'S FLIRTING?!" Shin and Ai yelled at the same time.
And so, another fun-filled day at school came to a chaotic, laughter-filled close.
You said:
a few days later its a return of ai trying to make shin blush paln after a long time.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 134 – Operation: Make Shin Blush (Again)
Ai had been too relaxed lately. With all the chaos of Christmas, New Year’s, and the school trip, she had let her guard down.
And worse…
Shin had the upper hand lately.
She couldn’t allow that.

The Plan Begins
Ai sat in class, smirking to herself.
("It’s been a while since I’ve gone on the offensive. Time to remind him who he’s dealing with!")
She stole a glance at Shin, who was lazily leaning back in his chair, flipping through his textbook like he wasn’t even paying attention.
Kazama, next to him, was taking perfect notes, occasionally side-eyeing Shin like he was personally offended by his lack of effort.
Ai tapped her pen against her lips, deep in thought.
("I could go with the classic close whisper technique, or maybe the sudden compliment. Hmm… No, I need something that will actually get a reaction!")
Her eyes gleamed.

Attempt #1 – The Sudden "Slip"
During lunch, the group gathered in the cafeteria.
As they walked, Ai pretended to lose her balance—and fell against Shin.
"Ah—Shin~!"
THUD.
Two things happened.
She landed against him, her hands on his chest, their faces inches apart.


Shin… didn’t react.


In fact, he just tilted his head.
"Yo, Ai, you good?"
Ai blinked.
("T-That was nothing to him?!")
Meanwhile, Kazama watched this unfold and sighed. "Seriously? That was such an obvious move."
Nene smirked. "You’re getting rusty, Ai."
Ai pouted. "It was just a warm-up!"

Attempt #2 – Whisper Attack
During student council work, Ai leaned in close, pretending to discuss paperwork.
Her breath grazed Shin’s ear.
"So, President~ Do I get a reward for working so hard?" she whispered.
Silence.
Shin turned to her…
…and just flicked her forehead.
"Do your work properly, Secretary."
Ai sat there frozen.
"What?!"
Kazama snorted. "You walked into that one."
Nene shook her head. "This is getting sad."
Ai gritted her teeth.
("Fine. If the cute approach isn’t working, I’ll just have to be bold!")

Attempt #3 – The Ultimate Attack
After school, the group was hanging out near the lockers.
This was it.
Her final attack.
Ai took a deep breath… then grabbed Shin’s tie, yanking him down slightly so their faces were dangerously close.
"Shin, do you really feel nothing when I do this?"
For the first time that day—
Shin froze.
His eyes widened.
His ears turned slightly red.
Ai grinned. ("Got him.")
But then—
Shin smirked.
"Oh? Do you feel something, Ai?"
Ai froze.
Nene, Kazama, and Masao all gasped.
"NO WAY—"
Ai quickly let go and turned around. "I-I’m going home!"
Shin just stretched, yawning. "Man, today was weird."
As Ai stormed off, her face burning, she made one final decision—
("I need a new strategy…")
You said:
its friday and shin over hears late at night hima talking to kazam and they planned to go some where!! new spy mission with ai.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 135 – Mission: Spy on Hima & Kazama!
Friday Night – The Suspicious Conversation
It was late at night, and Shin was heading to the kitchen for a late snack when he heard voices.
He froze at the bottom of the stairs.
Hima’s voice.
And… Kazama’s?!
He peered around the corner and saw his little sister on the phone, whispering.
"Mm-hmm! Yeah, let’s meet there! I already got everything planned, Kazama!"
Shin’s eyes narrowed.
("Meet where?! Plan what?!")
Then—
Kazama’s voice, muffled but clear, came through the phone:
"Alright, just don’t tell Shin. If he finds out, he’ll get annoying."
Shin gritted his teeth. ("Oh, hell no.")

The Mission Begins
The next morning, Shin pulled Ai aside before school.
"Ai. We have a problem."
Ai raised an eyebrow. "What, did you forget your homework again?"
"This is serious." Shin leaned in. "Hima and Kazama… are planning something."
Ai blinked. Then smirked. "Oh? Are we jealous, big brother?"
Shin ignored that. "I don’t know what it is, but they’re hiding it from me. We need to follow them."
Ai’s eyes sparkled. "So, you’re saying… a spy mission?"
Shin nodded.
Ai grinned. "Say no more. I’m in!"

Operation: Spy on Hima & Kazama
That afternoon, after school, they tailed Kazama.
Step one: Camouflage.
Ai had on a hat and sunglasses. Shin wore a hoodie with the hood up.
"Shin, you look more like a criminal than a spy," Ai whispered.
"Shh. He’s moving!"
Kazama entered a café.
Shin and Ai pressed against the window, peering inside.
And there she was—Hima!
She waved at Kazama, then handed him… a small box?!
Ai gasped. "Is that… a gift?!"
Shin’s eye twitched. "What is going on here?!"

Step Two: Infiltration
They slipped into the café, choosing a table nearby.
Ai held up a newspaper. "We need to hear what they’re saying."
Shin leaned forward.
Hima: "This is just between us, okay?"
Kazama nodded. "Got it."
Shin’s fist clenched. ("WHAT is between them?!")
Ai whispered, "I bet it’s a confession."
Shin choked. "SHUT UP."
Then—Kazama opened the box.
Inside…
A decorated keychain.
Hima smiled. "It’s for your bag! You always have that plain-looking one."
Kazama blinked. "Oh. That’s… actually really nice."
Hima grinned. "See? I have a matching one!" She pulled out a keychain with the same design.
Kazama looked away. "T-Thanks."
Ai held back a laugh. "Aww, Kazama’s blushing."
Shin let out a long sigh. "I swear, if I had a heart condition, you’d both kill me."

Step Three: Extraction
As they exited the café, Ai stretched. "Well, that was wholesome."
Shin rubbed his temples. "So it was just about keychains."
Ai nudged him. "Admit it, you were worried for nothing."
Shin grumbled. "Whatever."
Then—
A voice behind them.
"...Why are you two following us?"
Shin and Ai froze.
Hima and Kazama stood there, arms crossed.
Ai giggled nervously. "Uh… coffee run?"
Kazama sighed. "You two are the worst spies ever."
Hima just shook her head. "Seriously, Shin-nii, get a life."
Shin just grinned. "Nope. I’m your big brother. This IS my life."

Caught in the Act
Shin and Ai stood frozen as Hima and Kazama stared them down.
Hima tapped her foot, arms crossed. "So? Are you two going to explain why you were following us?"
Ai, ever the smooth talker, cleared her throat. "We were, um... just here for a coffee run?"
Shin nodded way too fast. "Yeah. Totally normal coffee run. Nothing suspicious at all."
Kazama sighed, rubbing his temples. "Unbelievable."
Hima squinted. "You guys are so bad at lying."
Ai nudged Shin. "This is your fault! You dragged me into this!"
Shin whispered back, "You volunteered!"
Hima sighed dramatically. "Alright, let me clear this up before your idiot brain starts making up weird scenarios."
Shin frowned. "Rude."
Hima ignored him. "This was not a date. Kazama was just helping me study for a test."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "…Kazama? Helping you study?"
Kazama looked annoyed. "What's that supposed to mean?"
"Nothing, nothing. Just didn’t know you tutored middle schoolers now."
Kazama scoffed. "Oh, shut up. I was just helping her with some practice questions."
Hima rolled her eyes. "And also, I was here to buy something."
She held up a small, neatly wrapped box.
Shin blinked. "…For who?"
Hima smirked. "For you, obviously."
Ai gasped. "Aww, that’s so sweet! Hima-chan, you’re such a thoughtful little sister!"
Shin stared. "Wait. What? Why?"
Hima pouted. "Because I wanted to? What, am I not allowed to buy my own brother a present?"
Shin scratched his head. "Uh… I mean, it’s not like I don’t appreciate it, but—"
Hima huffed. "Just take it when I give it to you later, alright?"
Shin shrugged. "Fine, fine."
Kazama sighed in relief. "So, now that you two understand the situation, can we all go home like normal people?"
Ai grinned. "Sure, sure. But Kazama, you have to admit, you two did look kinda suspicious."
Kazama scowled. "We really didn’t."
Shin smirked. "Oh, you so did."
Hima stomped her foot. "UGH! You're impossible! Let’s just go already!"

The Walk Home
As they made their way back, Shin glanced at the small gift box in Hima’s hands.
"...So, what did you get me, anyway?"
Hima stuck her tongue out. "Not telling. You’ll find out later."
Ai smirked. "Oh? A mystery gift? Now I’m curious!"
Kazama sighed. "You’re always curious."
Ai grinned. "Of course! It’s part of my charm."
Shin shook his head as they walked under the setting sun.
At the end of the day, his little sister was still a kid—one who infuriated him sometimes but also knew how to catch him off guard in the best way.
And as much as he hated to admit it…
He was lucky to have her.
You said:
as they reached home he popped her a question about kazama and valentines day, to test the water of her and their parents reaction.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 137 – Testing the Waters
The Setup
The house was warm, the scent of dinner filling the air as Shin, Ai, Hima, and Kazama stepped inside. Hiroshi was already in his pajamas, flipping through TV channels, while Misae was setting the table.
"Welcome back," Misae said without looking up. "Wash your hands before you eat."
Shin stretched lazily, shooting a glance at Hima, who was setting her bag down.
He smirked. Now’s my chance.
"Oi, Hima," he called casually, making sure his voice sounded offhanded. "So… Valentine's Day is coming up soon."
Hima froze mid-step.
Misae and Hiroshi both turned their heads.
Ai immediately perked up.
"Ohhh?" Ai grinned, elbows on the table. "What’s this about Valentine’s Day, hmm?"
Hima slowly turned, eyes narrowed. "What about it?"
Shin shrugged. "Just wondering… do you have any plans?"
The room went silent.
Kazama, who was drinking water, choked.
Hima's expression twitched. "W-why do you care?"
Shin leaned back with a smirk. "Just curious, you know? I mean, it’s a big deal for a middle schooler. Maybe you have someone in mind?"
Misae, who had just sat down, perked up too. "Oh? Hima-chan, do you?"
Hiroshi chuckled. "Oho, so that’s what this is about."
Hima looked trapped.
Ai, fully enjoying the chaos, turned to Kazama. "Kazama-kun, what about you? Any special plans for Valentine's Day?"
Kazama glared at Ai. "Don’t drag me into this."
Shin, still watching Hima closely, hummed. "I dunno, I feel like she might want to give chocolates to someone special this year."
Hima visibly flinched.
Misae gasped. "Wait… could it be?!"
Shin hid his grin. Hook, line, and sinker.
"Is it someone we know?" Hiroshi added with an amused look.
Hima, now extremely defensive, turned red. "I-It’s not like that! I—It’s just normal obligation chocolates!"
Ai tilted her head. "Obligation chocolates for who?"
Shin pretended to think. "Hmm, let’s see… maybe Kazama?"
The entire room exploded.
Misae and Hiroshi: "EH?!"
 Kazama: "HUH?!"
 Hima: "WHAT?!"
Shin bit his tongue to keep from laughing.
Ai lost it. "PFFT—Shin-chan, you’re evil!"
Hima grabbed a cushion and hurled it at Shin. "I HATE YOU!"
Kazama, now extremely flustered, cleared his throat. "W-why would you—? That’s—that’s completely ridiculous!"
Misae clapped her hands together. "Oh my goodness! Hima-chan and Kazama-kun? That’s adorable!"
Hiroshi laughed. "Wow, Kazama, you’re already family at this point!"
Kazama: "STOP SAYING THAT!"
Shin, finally breaking into laughter, wiped a tear from his eye. "Pfft—just testing the waters!"
Hima, red as a tomato, pointed at Shin. "I SWEAR I’LL KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP!"
Misae, still giggling, turned to Kazama. "But honestly, Kazama-kun, what do you think of Hima-chan?"
Kazama, cornered, avoided eye contact. "I… I think she’s… annoying?"
Hima glared.
Shin grinned. "Hmm… but?"
Kazama sighed. "…But she’s a good kid."
The table went silent for a moment.
Then Hima, still blushing, mumbled, "W-whatever."
Ai smiled knowingly. Oh? Interesting.
Shin leaned back, victorious. "Welp. That was fun."
Kazama muttered under his breath, "I hate you."
Shin grinned. "I know."
Ai whispered to Hima. "I think that went well."
Hima buried her face in her hands. "Shut up."
You said:
its valentines day at high school. things get spicy.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 138 – Valentine’s Day Chaos
The morning sun cast a warm golden glow over the high school, but inside the walls of Kasukabe High, things were anything but warm and calm.
It was Valentine’s Day.
And that meant pure chaos.
Chocolate Warfare
Shin strolled into school completely unbothered, hands in his pockets, his usual lazy grin on his face.
“Yo, Shin-chan!” Kazama greeted him, looking unusually tense.
Shin raised an eyebrow. “What’s up with you?”
Kazama looked around as if checking for snipers. “It’s Valentine’s Day. I don’t trust anyone today.”
Before Shin could respond, a loud thud echoed from behind them.
Masao was face-first on the ground, a massive bag of chocolates spilling out of his arms.
“MASAO!” Nene, standing nearby, scowled. “You dropped them again?!”
Masao groaned. “I—I didn’t mean to! There were just so many…”
Rika, arms crossed, smirked. “Damn, Masao. Didn’t expect you to be this popular.”
Shin whistled. “Guess all that ‘soft boy’ charm finally worked, huh?”
Masao turned bright red. “T-they’re just obligatory chocolates! I swear!”
Nene huffed. “Hmph. Well, good for you.”
Shin noticed the subtle frown on Nene’s face. He raised an eyebrow. Oh? Interesting.
Before he could tease her, his own crisis began.
The Onslaught
“Shin-kun!”
Shin turned just in time to see three underclassmen running toward him, holding carefully wrapped chocolates.
“Here! I made these for you!” one girl said, blushing.
“Me too!” another added.
A third girl hesitated. “It’s… it’s not much, but I’d be really happy if you took it.”
Shin blinked. “Huh?”
Kazama stepped back, smirking. “Oh wow, look who’s popular today.”
Shin took the chocolates, scratching his cheek. “Uh… thanks?”
Before he could fully process what was happening, more girls appeared.
“Shin-chan! Please accept this!”
“Shin-senpai! I worked really hard on this!”
“SHIN-KUN, I LOVE Y—”
Shin had to literally dodge as another girl nearly threw chocolates at him.
Kazama was losing it. “Pfft—this is hilarious.”
Ai, who had just walked in, saw the entire scene and stopped dead in her tracks.
Her eye twitched.
Shin finally managed to escape the mob, slipping into class and dropping onto his desk like he had just survived a battlefield.
Kazama sat beside him, amused. “Wow. Didn’t think you’d get this much attention.”
Shin groaned. “What the hell was that?”
Kazama smirked. “Guess girls like an idiot with confidence.”
Shin clicked his tongue. “That was way too much energy for this early in the morning.”
Then, just as he closed his eyes, a shadow loomed over him.
He opened one eye.
Ai stood there, arms crossed, not looking pleased.
“…Yo.”
Ai tilted her head. “So, how many chocolates did you get, Shin-chan?”
Shin glanced at the pile of chocolates on his desk.
“…Uh.”
Ai smiled. “Wow, so many girls like you, huh?”
Shin gulped. Oh no.
Kazama quietly slid away.
Ai’s ‘Spicy’ Plan
Lunch arrived, and Shin was just about to relax when he was suddenly dragged away.
“Ai—wait—what the hell?!”
Ai pulled him into an empty student council room, shutting the door behind them.
Shin blinked. “Oi, what’s up with you?”
Ai leaned against the desk, arms crossed. “You really don’t get it, do you?”
Shin scratched his head. “Get what?”
Ai sighed dramatically. “So many girls gave you chocolates… but don’t you think you’re missing something?”
Shin blinked again. “Huh?”
Ai leaned forward. “Did you expect chocolates from me?”
Shin’s brain short-circuited.
“…I mean, I wouldn’t not expect them?”
Ai smirked. “Good answer.”
She reached into her bag and pulled out a small, neatly wrapped box.
Shin stared at it. “…Is that?”
Ai twirled a strand of hair. “Maybe.”
Shin took the box carefully, inspecting it like it might explode.
Ai giggled. “Go on. Open it.”
Shin unwrapped it, revealing homemade chocolates in the shape of little dog bones.
He snorted. “You made them look like Shiro’s treats?”
Ai grinned. “I thought it was fitting.”
Shin chuckled and picked one up, popping it into his mouth.
Then he paused.
The taste hit him.
Rich, sweet, slightly bitter chocolate—it was perfect.
Ai watched him carefully. “Well?”
Shin chewed slowly. “Damn… this is actually good.”
Ai smirked. “Obviously.”
Shin nodded, grinning. “Thanks, Ai.”
Ai tilted her head, mischief in her eyes. “You know, Shin-chan…”
Shin looked up. “Hm?”
Ai suddenly leaned in close, her breath warm against his skin.
Shin froze.
Ai whispered. “If you really want to thank me… maybe you should do something in return.”
Shin felt his entire body heat up. “W—what?”
Ai tilted her head innocently. “What, Shin-chan? Too much for you?”
Shin quickly turned away. “Tch. You’re annoying.”
Ai giggled. “Aww, you’re blushing.”
Shin clicked his tongue. “I AM NOT.”
Ai smirked. “Suuuuure.”
Shin groaned. “Just… shut up and let me eat my chocolate.”
Ai smiled softly. “Happy Valentine’s, Shin-chan.”
Shin chewed his chocolate and mumbled.
“…Yeah. You too.”
Ai giggled again. Finally… progress.
You said:
things progressed nicely for the group, then suddenly finally the final exams are here. but after the 1st half exam of the year the grp wanted to see how did shin actually studied, despite his behaviour, to score perfect in math and science, and above 90 in history and japanese, so they crashed at his place a week before the exam.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 139 – The Mystery of Shin-chan’s Studying
The air was tense in Kasukabe High School—not because of a fight, not because of a major event, but because…
Final exams had arrived.
And while the rest of the school was suffering, one mystery continued to bother Shin’s friend group.
Despite his carefree attitude, Shin-chan’s grades were ridiculously high.
Math and Science? Perfect scores.
 History and Japanese? Above 90%.
 Everything else? Way better than expected.
This was the same Shin-chan who barely paid attention in class, napped during lectures, and caused chaos on a daily basis.
It didn’t add up.
So, in the spirit of true scientific inquiry (and because they desperately needed to study), the group decided to crash at Shin’s house a week before the exams.

Friday – Study Crash at the Nohara Residence
“Shin-chan! Open up!”
The doorbell rang aggressively as Nene pounded on the door.
Inside, Shin sat on the couch, lazily flipping through channels.
“Shin-chan, your friends are here!” Misae called from the kitchen.
Shin yawned. “They could’ve just let me enjoy my last few days of peace…”
As he got up and opened the door, the entire squad was standing outside.
Kazama, Ai, Nene, Masao, Bo, and even Rika.
Ai grinned. “Hope you didn’t think you were gonna escape this, Shin-chan.”
Shin rubbed his temple. “Escape what? This is just an excuse for you guys to eat my food and take over my house, isn’t it?”
Masao sweated nervously. “T-that’s not completely untrue…”
Kazama adjusted his bag. “We want to see how you study. There’s no way you’re getting those grades by slacking off.”
Shin sighed. “You guys seriously have nothing better to do?”
Nene pushed past him. “Nope!”
Bo followed silently, Masao hesitated at the entrance, and Ai smirked as she walked by, brushing past Shin.
Ai whispered, “I’m looking forward to learning all your secrets, Shin-chan.”
Shin shivered. “Creepy.”

Phase 1 – Study Time?
Once everyone settled into Shin’s room, the group set up their books and notes.
Shin, meanwhile, laid down on his futon, arms behind his head.
Nene glared at him. “Shin-chan, what the hell are you doing?!”
Shin yawned. “Relaxing.”
Kazama crossed his arms. “A week before exams?”
Shin smirked. “Exactly.”
Kazama twitched. “HOW do you score so well while being like this?!”
Shin grinned. “Magic.”
Ai narrowed her eyes. “You do study, don’t you?”
Shin finally sat up, stretching. “Of course I do.”
Masao looked shocked. “Wait… really?”
Shin tilted his head. “What, you thought I was just born a genius?”
Kazama grumbled. “That would explain a lot…”
Nene huffed. “Then prove it. Study right now.”
Shin rolled his eyes. “Fine, fine.”
He lazily got up, grabbed a random math book, and flipped to a completely blank page.
Then, without looking at any formulas, he solved three problems in under a minute.
The room went silent.
Masao’s jaw dropped. “T-that was… fast.”
Kazama narrowed his eyes. “Did you memorize the answers?”
Shin smirked. “Nope.”
Ai leaned forward, curious. “How?”
Shin stretched. “I don’t waste time memorizing. I just understand it. That way, I don’t have to cram like you guys.”
Nene stared. “What the hell does that mean?!”
Shin grinned. “It means I actually listen in class.”
Everyone: “LIES.”
Shin laughed. “No seriously. I just pay attention to the important stuff. If you know the basics, everything else just makes sense.”
Kazama groaned. “So that’s why you don’t take notes.”
Shin pointed at him. “Exactly.”
Masao, still in shock, whispered. “So… you’re actually smart?”
Shin shrugged. “Guess so.”
Ai smirked. “I always knew it.”
Nene gritted her teeth. “So unfair… I actually have to study!”
Bo, who had been silent, finally spoke. “That’s impressive, Shin.”
Shin grinned. “Thanks, Bo-chan.”
Kazama sighed. “Well, at least now we know you’re not a cheater.”
Shin grinned wider. “Hey, I might be a lot of things, but I’m no cheater.”
Nene groaned. “Ugh. This is frustrating. I thought we’d catch him.”
Ai smiled. “Too bad, Nene. Shin-chan’s just naturally talented.”
Shin smirked. “And I don’t even try that hard.”
Kazama and Nene: “STOP BRAGGING.”

Phase 2 – ‘Studying’ (AKA Hanging Out)
Despite their original plan, studying lasted for about 20 minutes before the group got distracted.
Kazama tried to quiz everyone on history.
 Masao got depressed over his wrong answers.
 Nene started doodling on her textbook out of frustration.
 Bo was the only one actually studying.
 Ai? Ai was watching Shin-chan the whole time.
Then, Misae knocked on the door. “Dinner’s ready!”
And just like that, studying was over.

Phase 3 – Late Night Chaos
After dinner, the real fun began.
They played games, watched TV, and even raided the fridge again at midnight.
Shin caught Kazama and Masao trying to sneak more food.
“Oi, that’s my midnight snack.”
Masao flinched. “P-please don’t kill me, Shin-chan!”
Kazama scoffed. “You don’t even cook, why do you care?”
Shin narrowed his eyes. “You dare underestimate my instant ramen skills?”
Ai giggled. “I’d actually like to see that.”
Shin smirked. “Maybe next time.”
Finally, around 2 AM, the group crashed in the living room, completely exhausted.
Masao was snoring.
 Kazama was still mumbling history facts in his sleep.
 Bo looked peaceful.
 Nene was hugging a pillow aggressively.
 Ai? Ai was stealing Shin’s blanket.
Shin yawned, stretching out.
“Guess even geniuses need sleep, huh?” Ai murmured.
Shin grinned sleepily. “Even geniuses don’t wanna fail, y’know?”
Ai smiled. “Goodnight, Shin-chan.”
Shin smirked. “Night, Ai.”
And just like that, their ‘study session’ ended—
With zero studying…
And a perfectly normal night at Shin’s house.
You said:
then kazama scremed at the conditon and the shit they did the entire day instead of studying.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 140 – The Wrath of Kazama
It was Saturday morning.
Sunlight streamed into the disastrous Nohara living room.
Empty snack wrappers.
 Cups of instant ramen.
 Game controllers scattered across the floor.
 Masao still drooling on a pillow.
And in the middle of it all…
Kazama woke up.

Kazama’s Breakdown
Kazama sat up, rubbing his temple. His body was sore from sleeping on the floor, his hair was a mess, and then—
He saw the disaster.
His eye twitched.
His fingers shook.
His soul left his body.
And then…
“WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?!”
The entire room shook as Kazama screamed.
Shin, who was half-asleep, simply turned over and yawned. “Ugh, what’s with the noise…?”
Kazama turned to look at the source of his suffering.
Shinnosuke Nohara.
Laying down peacefully in his futon.
Not a single care in the world.
Ai was next to him, half-covered in his blanket, still asleep.
Nene groggily sat up. “What’s… going on…?”
Kazama pointed at everything.
“The mess! The food! The games! The fact that we were supposed to be STUDYING!!”
Masao, still half-asleep, mumbled. “We studied, right?”
Kazama turned red. “We did NOT study, Masao!”
Bo, stretching, calmly said, “Technically, Shin did.”
Kazama glared. “He solved three problems and then spent the rest of the night being an idiot like always!”
Shin sat up, still looking sleepy. “Hey, don’t lump me in with the rest of you. I am ready for the exam.”
Kazama looked like he was about to explode.
Ai finally woke up, rubbing her eyes. “Kazama, it’s too early for this…”
Kazama pointed at her. “You were supposed to stop Shin from being like this!”
Ai yawned. “I was too busy enjoying the view.”
Kazama’s brain short-circuited. “WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!”
Masao looked at his textbook. “Wait… guys… we really didn’t study?”
Nene facepalmed. “No, Masao. We didn’t.”
Masao started panicking. “B-but the exam! The grades! My future!”
Kazama grabbed his head. “You should’ve thought about that BEFORE playing video games all night!”
Masao clutched his chest. “I thought we’d get serious at some point…”
Shin grinned. “You thought wrong.”
Kazama collapsed onto the floor, staring at the ceiling.
“I’m surrounded by idiots.”

Kazama’s Last Attempt
After some yelling, complaints, and more yelling, Kazama forced everyone to sit down at the table.
“No distractions. No nonsense. We are going to study,” he said firmly.
Nene groaned. “Ugh, fine.”
Masao still looked like he was mourning his life choices.
Bo nodded. “Okay.”
Ai smirked. “I’ll try to behave.”
Shin leaned back in his chair. “You do realize I’m already done studying, right?”
Kazama snapped.
“THEN SIT THERE AND SUFFER WITH US!”
And just like that, the study session finally began…
Well—
For about 15 minutes before they got distracted again.
Shin-chan’s house was just built different.
You said:
so they decided to go to a library, this time more people joint them.(rika, hayashi and yusuo.)
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 141 – The Library Lockdown
Kazama was done.
No, seriously. Done.
Shin’s house was a black hole for productivity.
If they stayed there any longer, half the group would fail the exams, and Kazama would lose his sanity.
So, with fire in his eyes, he declared:
"WE’RE GOING TO THE LIBRARY!"

The Great Migration
After forcing everyone to change out of their lazy clothes, they made their way to the city library.
However, more people joined.
Rika (because she wanted to be near Bo… totally not blushing whenever he talked to her)


Hayashi (who just followed Kazama without question)


Yasuo (who Kazama dragged along because he “looked smarter than the rest”)


By the time they reached the library, their group had grown way too big.
The librarian stared at them.
The students studying stared at them.
A mother with her child stared at them.
Shin leaned toward Kazama and whispered, “It kinda feels like we’re about to invade this place.”
Kazama just sighed. “Just… let’s just sit down and actually study.”

The Study Session Begins… Or Not?
They finally found a long table in a quiet corner.
Kazama organized everyone’s books.
"Alright, we’re going to study properly this time. No distractions, no talking, just focused learning.”
Shin raised his hand. “What if I already know everything?”
Kazama slammed his book onto the table. "THEN JUST PRETEND TO STUDY!"
Shin leaned back. “Harsh.”
30 minutes later…
The library was peaceful.
For the first time, they were actually studying.
Even Masao was focused (because he was terrified of failing).
Bo calmly wrote notes, Ai scribbled away, and Nene even looked serious.
Everything was going so well.
Until…

The Disaster Begins
Rika stole glances at Bo.


Her heart raced every time he leaned closer to look at her book.


She blushed so hard she couldn’t focus.


“I-Is it hot in here…?”


Hayashi and Yasuo whispered about random nonsense.


“Do you think aliens have exams?”


“Bro, I hope not.”


Shin got bored.


He nudged Ai.


Ai ignored him.


He poked her.


Ai still ignored him.


He drew a tiny mustache on her notebook.


That’s when she turned and smacked his arm.
Which made him flinch.
Which made his book fall.
Which made Kazama snap.
"SHINNOSUKE, YOU—"
The librarian glared at them from across the room.
Kazama froze.
So did everyone else.
And then…
She shushed them.
Loudly.

The Aftermath
After that, the group actually managed to study for real (mostly because Kazama looked like he was ready to fight God if anyone interrupted again).
They stayed there for hours.
By the time they left, the sky had turned orange.
Shin stretched. “Well, that was something.”
Kazama glared at him. “You didn’t study. At all.”
Shin grinned. “Yeah, but you did, right?”
Kazama clenched his fists.
Ai giggled. “At least we got some work done.”
Masao sighed in relief. “I think I finally understand history…”
Nene nodded. “Yeah, I think this helped.”
Bo simply said, “It was peaceful.”
Rika, still blushing, glanced at Bo and mumbled, “Y-Yeah…”
Kazama took a deep breath. They did it.
They actually managed to study.
He smiled to himself. Maybe they weren’t hopeless after all.
Then Shin said—
“So, ramen before heading home?”
Kazama’s eye twitched.
…They were still idiots.
You said:
that night ai felt like tlaking to shin for some reason so she called him with the pretext of a doubt in a question.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 142 – Midnight Calls and Hidden Meanings
It was late.
The city lights outside Ai’s window twinkled against the quiet night. The study session at the library had been productive (surprisingly), and now everyone had gone home, getting ready for another day of school.
Yet, Ai lay in her bed, wide awake.
She stared at her phone, the soft glow of the screen illuminating her face.
For some reason…
She just wanted to talk to him.

The Call
Ring. Ring. Ring.
Shin groggily picked up his phone. “...Who’s dying?”
Ai pouted. “You sound half-dead yourself.”
Shin yawned. “Because I was sleeping.”
“Then wake up.”
“Not happening. Bye.”
Click.
Ai blinked.
Then she called again.
Shin picked up, groaning, “Seriously? Ai, it’s late.”
Ai crossed her arms, even though he couldn’t see her. “I have a question about the math problem we studied.”
Shin was silent for a second. Then, “That’s a lie.”
Ai flinched. “W-What? No, it’s not!”
Shin snorted. “Ai-chan, you scored perfect on the last math test. You don’t need help.”
“…Maybe I forgot something.”
“Liar.”
Ai huffed. “Fine. Maybe I just… wanted to talk.”
Shin was quiet.
Then, after a beat—
“…Okay.”
Ai’s heart skipped. “Okay?”
“You called me to talk, right? So talk.”
Ai froze.
She hadn’t expected him to just go with it.
She sat up, hugging her knees. “...Are you really okay with late-night calls?”
Shin yawned. “You’re the one who called, not me.”
Ai bit her lip. “Then why didn’t you just ignore it?”
“Dunno. Maybe I wanted to talk too.”
Ai’s face heated up.
She quickly looked away from her phone (as if that would help).
Shin chuckled. “What, are you blushing?”
“No!”
“Sounds like something a blushing person would say.”
Ai puffed her cheeks. “I swear, you’re insufferable.”
“But you still called me.”
“…Shut up.”

Midnight Conversations
They talked about random things.
The library study session.


How Kazama nearly exploded.


Bo’s scary ability to stay silent for hours.


Rika acting weird around Bo.


Masao actually studying for once.


But then, the conversation slowed.
The laughter faded, replaced with quiet breathing over the phone.
Ai hesitated, then softly asked, “Hey… what do you think about the future?”
Shin was silent for a moment.
“The future?”
“Yeah. Like… after high school.”
“…Haven’t really thought about it.”
Ai hummed. “I guess that’s very you.”
“What about you?”
Ai hesitated. “I… don’t know yet.”
Shin yawned. “Then why ask me?”
“I just…” Ai’s grip on her blanket tightened. “I guess I wanted to know if you planned on going far away.”
Shin blinked at his ceiling. “Far away?”
Ai quickly backtracked. “N-Not that it matters! I mean, it’s your choice and all, but—”
“I don’t think I’ll go far.”
Ai froze.
Shin scratched his head. “I like where I am. Feels like leaving would be annoying.”
Ai held her phone tighter. “So… you’d stay?”
“Yeah. Probably.”
Ai smiled softly.
Shin yawned again. “You sound happy.”
Ai quickly composed herself. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Shin smirked. “Liar.”
Ai pouted. “You’re annoying.”
“And you’re still talking to me.”
“…Shut up.”
Shin chuckled. “Go to sleep, Ai-chan.”
Ai glanced at the clock. It was past midnight.
She sighed. “Fine. Goodnight, Shin-chan.”
Shin murmured sleepily, “Night.”
Ai hesitated.
Then, before she could stop herself—
“…Thanks for picking up.”
Shin, half-asleep, muttered, “Always.”
Ai’s heart stuttered.
She quickly ended the call.
Burying her face in her pillow, she muttered, “…Idiot.”
But… she fell asleep with a smile.
You said:
the exam day is here, they force throught it, but unlike last time their are more people(rika, yosuo,hayshi)
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 143 – Exam Day: The Struggle is Real
The dreaded exam day had arrived.
The school hallways buzzed with tension. Students huddled in corners, flipping through notebooks with desperation. Some whispered formulas like prayers. Others just sat in silence, accepting their fate.
And then…
There was Shin’s group.

The Pre-Exam Chaos
Kazama paced back and forth in front of their usual spot near the lockers. “Okay! One last time! The chemical formula for sulfuric acid?”
“H₂SO₄!” Ai, Nene, and Rika responded instantly.
Kazama nodded, satisfied. “Good. And the mitochondria is—”
“The powerhouse of the cell!” Masao and Yasuo said in unison.
“Of course you know that one,” Kazama muttered.
Meanwhile, Hayashi flipped through his book with shaky hands. “I-I don’t know if I’m ready. I feel like I’m going to blank out.”
Shin patted his back. “Relax. Just write something. The teachers will pity you.”
Hayashi paled. “That’s not how it works!!”
Bo stood silently. He was either incredibly calm or had completely given up.
Nene sighed dramatically. “This sucks. We should’ve skipped.”
Kazama’s eye twitched. “You absolute fool. Do you realize the importance of these exams?”
Masao nodded seriously. “Yeah. If we fail, we’ll have to retake them. Which means… more exams.”
Everyone collectively shuddered.

The Exam Begins
The classroom was silent.
Only the sound of pens scratching against paper filled the air.
Shin leaned back in his chair, reading the first question.
“What is the main theme of ‘The Tale of Genji’?”
Shin stared at the paper. Uhhh… love? Betrayal? Something poetic?
He glanced at Ai, who was writing at lightning speed.
He glanced at Kazama, who looked like he was solving the meaning of life.
Then he glanced at Masao… who was crying internally.
Shin sighed and started writing.

An Hour Later…
Ai finished first. She stretched, glancing at Shin.
He was leaning on his hand, lazily writing.
She narrowed her eyes. How is he so relaxed?
Then, she glanced at Bo.
Bo was done.
Bo was napping.
Ai: “…What?”

Break Time: The Aftermath
When the bell rang, chaos erupted.
Students poured out of classrooms, comparing answers like their lives depended on it.
Nene groaned. “That was awful. I forgot how to spell catastrophe.”
Masao blinked. “How did you spell it?”
“C-A-T-S-T-R-O-F-Y.”
“…You just wrote ‘cat’ and gave up halfway, didn’t you?”
Nene covered her face. “Shut up.”
Meanwhile, Rika, Hayashi, and Yasuo were huddled together.
Hayashi looked traumatized. “I blanked out… I blacked out… I might as well drop out…”
Rika patted his back. “It’s okay, we all struggled.”
Kazama stormed up to Shin, eyes blazing. “You. How did you answer the essay question?”
Shin yawned. “Wrote some stuff. Probably right.”
Kazama grabbed his shoulders. “TELL ME. HOW.”
Ai smirked. “Didn’t you call him an idiot yesterday?”
Kazama’s eye twitched.
Shin grinned. “You’ll understand one day, my dear Kazama.”
Kazama: “YOU LITTLE—”
Masao and Bo had to hold him back.
And with that, the battle of exam day ended…
For now.
You said:
they went to bolleying a new place. after exam.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 144 – Post-Exam Bowling Chaos
The moment exams ended, the group practically sprinted out of the school.
“We’re free!” Nene cheered, throwing her arms up dramatically.
Masao collapsed against a nearby wall. “I saw my soul leave my body during the math exam…”
Kazama rubbed his temples. “That’s because you answered everything with vibes instead of logic.”
Ignoring him, Masao looked up at the sky. “Never again. I swear, I’m going to actually study next time.”
Everyone stared at him.
“…Okay, I might not,” he admitted.
Shin stretched, yawning. “So, what now? We celebrating or what?”
Ai smirked. “Obviously. We’re going bowling.”

Arrival at the Bowling Alley
The group arrived at a newly opened bowling alley in town. It was bigger and fancier than the old one they used to go to as kids. Neon lights glowed along the lanes, and a faint scent of pizza and soda filled the air.
Kazama adjusted his jacket. “Alright, let’s keep things civilized and have a fun, casual game.”
Nene cracked her knuckles. “Who said anything about casual?”
Shin grinned. “Yeah. We’re here to destroy each other.”
Kazama sighed. “Why did I even come?”

Splitting into Teams
They split into two teams:
Team A: Shin, Ai, Bo, and Rika


Team B: Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Hayashi


“I feel like this is unfair,” Kazama muttered, looking at Shin’s team.
Nene smirked. “What? Afraid to lose?”
Kazama scoffed. “As if. Let’s just get this over with.”

The Game Begins
First up: Masao.
Masao stepped up, grabbed his bowling ball, took a deep breath, and… immediately slipped.
The ball went rolling at negative speed, barely making it halfway down the lane before stopping.
Silence.
Shin blinked. “Did you just fail at throwing the ball?”
Masao got up, wiping his hands. “T-That was just a warm-up…”
Nene facepalmed.

Next: Ai.
Ai confidently picked up her ball, lined up her shot, and rolled it with perfect form.
Strike!
She turned around with a smirk. “Too easy.”
Shin whistled. “Damn, okay.”
Kazama scowled. “Show-off.”

Then: Shin.
Shin casually grabbed his ball, barely aimed, and threw it with unnecessary force.
The ball slammed into the pins, sending them flying.
Another strike.
Ai crossed her arms. “Tch. Lucky shot.”
Shin grinned. “It’s called skill, Ai-chan.”
Kazama muttered under his breath, “More like brute force…”

The Midway Rivalry
The game turned chaotic.
Rika got distracted watching Bo and accidentally rolled her ball into the wrong lane.


Nene and Ai started a mini-rivalry, trying to outdo each other’s shots.


Bo… somehow got a strike without even trying.


Masao never recovered from his tragic first throw.


At some point, the game was less about bowling and more about taunting each other.
Kazama rubbed his temples. “Why do I always get dragged into this nonsense?”
Shin slung an arm around his shoulder. “Because deep down, you love it.”
Kazama sighed. “I hate that you’re right.”

Final Results
Team A won, mostly thanks to Shin’s brute force and Ai’s precision.
Team B’s loss? Well… Masao happened.
Nene glared at him. “You literally got zero points.”
Masao sniffled. “It’s not my fault! The ball just doesn’t like me!”
Hayashi patted his back. “It’s okay, buddy. Not everyone’s meant for bowling.”
Masao: “…That doesn’t help.”

Post-Game Ramen Stop
After bowling, they headed to a ramen shop to wrap up the day.
Ai stretched. “That was fun.”
Shin grinned. “Of course. Especially since we won.”
Kazama rolled his eyes. “Don’t rub it in.”
As they ate, Bo casually looked at Rika and said, “You kept staring at me a lot today.”
Rika choked on her noodles. “W-What?! N-No, I didn’t!”
Shin and Ai exchanged knowing glances.
The night ended with laughter, teasing, and Masao swearing revenge on bowling itself.
And just like that, the post-exam celebration came to an end.

Chapter 145 – Exam Results and Bruised Egos
It was results day.
The school buzzed with a mixture of excitement and dread as students crowded around the notice boards, waiting for the scores to be posted.
“Alright, moment of truth.” Ai cracked her knuckles as she, Shin, and the rest of their group stood near the board.
Kazama adjusted his uniform. “Some of us don’t need to worry.” He threw a side glance at Shin.
Shin smirked. “Yeah, I wonder who…”
Kazama sighed. “I walked right into that.”
The teacher arrived, pinning the results up with a smug smile, knowing full well how much chaos this was about to cause.

Exam Scores
Shin: 100 (Math, Science), 96 (History), 94 (Japanese), 89 (English)


Kazama: 98 (Math), 97 (Science), 92 (History), 90 (Japanese), 95 (English)


Ai: 92 (Math), 93 (Science), 91 (History), 88 (Japanese), 90 (English)


Nene: 74 (Math), 79 (Science), 85 (History), 87 (Japanese), 83 (English)


Masao: 70 (Math), 73 (Science), 82 (History), 85 (Japanese), 80 (English)


Bo: 78 (Math), 75 (Science), 84 (History), 88 (Japanese), 79 (English)


Rika: 80 (Math), 82 (Science), 86 (History), 89 (Japanese), 91 (English)


Hayashi: 85 (Math), 86 (Science), 90 (History), 87 (Japanese), 92 (English)


Yasuo: 87 (Math), 85 (Science), 88 (History), 86 (Japanese), 90 (English)



Reactions
Nene threw her hands up. “I improved in every subject! I’m a genius!”
Kazama glanced at her scores. “I… wouldn’t go that far.”
Masao slumped against the wall. “I didn’t fail… but I still feel like a failure.”
Ai smiled, satisfied. “My scores are solid. Not bad at all.”
Bo simply nodded, unfazed. “Expected results.”
Rika clapped her hands together. “Everyone did better than last time. That’s a win in itself!”
Then, they turned to Shin.
Shin leaned back against the wall with his usual smug grin. “As expected.”
Kazama immediately turned away. “I refuse to acknowledge him.”
Ai pulled out her phone. “No one say anything, or his ego will skyrocket.”
Nene and Masao also deliberately ignored him.
Shin blinked. “Wait. Where’s my praise? My perfect scores? My undeniable brilliance?”
Bo, deadpan, “You’ll live.”
Shin gasped. “How dare you all.”
Kazama smirked. “We’ve learned. Feeding your ego is dangerous.”
Shin dramatically slumped to the floor. “So this is betrayal.”
The group walked off, leaving him pretending to be heartbroken.
Despite the teasing, everyone was relieved. The hard work had paid off, and this time, nobody had suffered a tragic score.

After School – Celebratory Hangout
That evening, the group met at their usual ramen shop.
Nene nudged Shin. “Be honest. Did you actually study, or do you just exist and somehow ace everything?”
Shin grinned. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
Kazama sighed. “I hate him.”
Masao slurped his noodles. “At least we survived.”
Ai smirked. “Next time, I’ll beat Shin’s score.”
Shin raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Challenge accepted, Ai-chan.”
And just like that, another round of rivalries, victories, and bruised egos came to a close.
You said:
they plan it to go to the beach just before the summer holiday starts, then the girls go for bikini shopping and with akari senpai's experience they had some fun designs.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 146 – Beach Plans & Bikini Shopping Chaos
With the summer holidays just around the corner, the group decided to squeeze in one last major trip before exams fully faded from their minds.
“Alright, beach trip is officially happening!” Ai declared, slamming her hands on the student council table.
Kazama adjusted his tie. “Shouldn’t we discuss the logistics—”
Shin interrupted, grinning. “Nah, all we need is the date, the location, and a good mood. Everything else is ‘figure-out-on-the-spot’ stuff.”
Bo nodded. “That’s usually how our trips go.”
Masao raised a hand hesitantly. “Do we even have the funds?”
Nene waved him off. “We’ll manage! The ocean calls!”
After some minimal planning (barely any), the trip was set.

The Girls' Side – Bikini Shopping
Two days later…
Ai, Nene, Rika, and Akari met up at the mall for one important task: swimsuit shopping.
“Alright, ladies,” Akari smirked, putting her hands on her hips. “You have the opportunity to stun this summer. Let’s pick something that will make the boys’ brains stop working.”
Nene grinned mischievously. “Especially Masao’s.”
Rika blushed. “T-that’s not why I’m here…”
Ai nodded. “I need something effective.”
Akari raised an eyebrow. “Effective?”
Ai smirked. “To make Shin flustered.”
Nene sighed dramatically. “Classic Ai.”

Trying Out Swimsuits
The girls split up and began trying on different bikinis.
Akari came out first in a bold red two-piece with stylish cutouts. She spun in front of the mirror. “Senpai-level confidence. This one’s a keeper.”
Nene emerged in a frilly, cute pastel swimsuit. “This fits my vibe, right?”
Ai gave her a thumbs-up. “It screams ‘Nene-chan.’”
Rika hesitantly stepped out in a sleek dark blue bikini. “This… feels a bit much.”
Akari whistled. “Girl, you look amazing. Trust me.”
Rika turned red. “T-thanks…”
Finally, Ai stepped out in a black, subtly elegant swimsuit with stylish straps. “Alright. How’s this?”
Nene blinked. “That’s… a weapon.”
Akari grinned. “Shin’s gonna lose his mind.”
Ai smirked. “That’s the goal.”

Meanwhile, The Boys’ Side
Shin, Kazama, Masao, Bo, and the others were completely oblivious to the chaos happening at the mall.
Kazama sipped his drink. “They’re probably just picking something practical.”
Shin raised an eyebrow. “You’re underestimating them.”
Bo nodded. “Something tells me they’re scheming.”
Masao shuddered. “…We’re doomed, aren’t we?”
Shin grinned. “Oh, absolutely.”
And with that, the countdown to the beach trip had begun.
You said:
it summer and time for beach(everone joined with hima too). it was about to be fun. first they met together and went by train.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 147 – The Beach Trip Begins!
Summer had officially arrived, and with it, the long-awaited beach trip.
“Finally!” Ai stretched her arms, basking in the warm sun as the group gathered at the train station. “It’s beach time!”
Nene grinned. “A whole day of sun, sand, and relaxation.”
Hima, who had been invited along, beamed. “I’ve been waiting for this all week!”
Shin looked around at their large and chaotic group:
The main crew: Shin, Ai, Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Bo.


The extended gang: Rika, Hayashi, Yasuo, Minami, Akari, and Ren.


Special guest: Hima (who had pretty much forced her way into the trip).


Masao adjusted his bag. “Are we sure this many people on one trip isn’t a disaster waiting to happen?”
Kazama sighed. “It’s too late to reconsider.”
Bo nodded. “We should just accept our fate.”
The train ride to the coastline was filled with energy.
Ai and Akari chatted about their bikini choices.


Hima and Nene teased Kazama.


Bo and Rika sat near the window, quietly enjoying the view.


Shin, Kazama, Masao, and the boys talked about potential beach games.


After an hour, they finally arrived.

Welcome to the Beach!
The moment they stepped off the train and onto the sand, the ocean breeze hit them.
“The sea!” Ai shouted, dramatically running forward. “It’s beautiful!”
“We can see that.” Shin smirked, adjusting his bag.
Kazama, as usual, had brought extra essentials like sunscreen, towels, and snacks. “Alright, before we do anything stupid, we should—”
Masao was already being dragged to the water by Nene.
“Come on, slowpoke!” she grinned.
Kazama sighed. “…And there goes any planning.”
The group quickly split up:
Swimming & Splash Wars: Ai, Shin, Nene, Masao, Bo, and Kazama.


Relaxing & Sunbathing: Akari, Minami, and Yasuo.


Shell Collecting & Photography: Hima, Rika, and Hayashi.



Chaos Ensues
As expected, things quickly got wild.
Ai vs. Shin Splash Battle: Ai tried to splash Shin, but he dodged and counterattacked so aggressively that she nearly got knocked over. "Not fair!" Ai pouted.


Masao & Nene’s Tug-of-War: Masao, flustered, tried to escape Nene’s grip, but she dragged him into deeper water. “I’m gonna drown!”


Bo, the Unexpected Swimmer: Everyone expected Bo to just chill, but he actually turned out to be a strong swimmer, shocking Rika. “…Why is that cool?” she mumbled, blushing.


Meanwhile, Hima and Rika were taking photos together, when suddenly—
“BIG WAVE!” someone yelled.
SPLASH!
Everyone who was near the shoreline got completely soaked.
Nene laughed. “This is the best!”
Shin shook his head, drenched. “…I should’ve stayed home.”
Ai smirked. “Too late, President.”

Next: Beach Games & Shenanigans!
With the day still young, the next stage of the beach trip was just about to begin!
You said:
they play volley ball and everyone there is super competetive.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 148 – The Ultimate Beach Volleyball Showdown
After the chaotic fun in the water, the group dried off, re-energized, and decided to play beach volleyball.
“Alright, we need teams!” Akari announced, clapping her hands.
Shin smirked. “This is just a friendly match, right?”
Kazama adjusted his imaginary glasses (which didn’t exist). “Nothing is ‘just friendly’ when competition is involved.”
And that was the beginning of the most competitive beach volleyball match ever.

The Teams
After some discussion, the teams were divided as follows:
🟠 Team A (Shin’s Team):
Shin


Ai


Kazama


Bo


Minami


🔵 Team B (Akari’s Team):
Akari


Nene


Masao


Rika


Yasuo


Referees & Commentators:
Hima (decided to officiate)


Hayashi (recording the match for ‘memories’)



Game Start!
Ai smirked, spinning the volleyball in her hand. “Time to show my athletic side, President.”
Shin yawned. “As long as we win, do whatever you want.”
Akari cracked her knuckles. “Prepare for defeat.”
Masao, however, was sweating bullets. “Why do I feel like I’m about to suffer?”

The Match
1st Set – Warm-Up… Or Not?
The game started with a perfect serve by Ai, but Akari expertly received it, setting up Nene for a spike.
WHAM!
Kazama barely saved it, and Shin counterattacked with a powerful return.
Rika, who wasn’t used to playing sports, dodged instead of blocking.
“Rika, don’t dodge!” Nene shouted.
“I panicked!” Rika defended herself.
🔹 Score: 1-0 (Shin’s team leads)

2nd Set – Masao’s Nightmare
Masao ended up being the weak link. Every time the ball came to him—
He tripped.


He missed.


He hit it the wrong way.


At one point, instead of hitting the ball, he somehow hit himself in the face.
“MASAO!” Nene yelled.
“I’M TRYING!” Masao wailed.
🔹 Score: 5-3 (Shin’s team still leads)

3rd Set – Bo’s Unexpected Talent
Then, something incredible happened.
Bo, usually quiet, jumped high and delivered an insane spike.
THWACK! The ball hit the sand with force.
Everyone stared in shock.
“Bo… YOU COULD DO THAT?!” Ai gasped.
Bo nodded. “…It’s just volleyball.”
Rika, watching him shine, blushed even harder. “Why is he so effortlessly cool?!” she muttered to herself.
🔹 Score: 9-5 (Shin’s team DOMINATES.)

Final Set – Shin vs. Akari Showdown
Akari, refusing to lose, turned up the heat. She set up a powerful spike, and it seemed like Shin wouldn’t reach in time.
But then—
Shin dived dramatically, saving the ball just in time.
Ai and Kazama quickly followed up, setting up for a final counterattack.
BAM!
The ball smashed onto the other side, ending the game.
🔹 Final Score: 15-10 (Shin’s team wins!)

Post-Match Chaos
Akari crossed her arms. “…We demand a rematch.”
Ai grinned. “Admit it, we’re just better.”
Masao, exhausted, collapsed on the sand. “I think I died.”
Bo, completely unfazed, just drank some juice.
Rika, still staring at Bo with sparkling eyes, was lost in her own thoughts.
Kazama sighed. “Why do we always turn everything into a war?”
Shin stretched. “Because winning is fun.”
Hima, finishing her referee role, clapped her hands. “Alright, what’s next?”

Next: Sandcastles, BBQ, & Night Fireworks!
With the volleyball match done, it was time for more beachside adventures!
You said:
before the above fun stuff, some guys come and approach ai hitting on her. and its time for serious shin to step up.(all that kendo is going to help).
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 149 – Don’t Mess With My Secretary
The beach was buzzing with energy after their intense volleyball match. The group had taken a short break, some grabbing drinks while others sat in the shade, cooling off from the sun.
Ai, still in high spirits, had wandered a little from the group to grab an ice pop from a vendor. She stood near the boardwalk, casually enjoying her treat.
That’s when they showed up.
A group of three older guys, probably college students, approached her with confident smirks. They were clearly not from their school and had a cocky, overfamiliar air.
“Hey, cutie, all alone?” The tallest one asked, running a hand through his gelled-back hair.
Ai frowned slightly but remained composed. “No, my friends are just over there.”
“Oh? What a coincidence, we’re here with some friends too.” The second guy chuckled. “Maybe we can all hang out? You seem like you’d be fun.”
The third guy leaned closer than necessary. “Or maybe just you and us?”
Ai immediately took a step back.

The Wrong Person to Mess With
From a few meters away, Shin’s eyes locked onto the situation.
His relaxed expression vanished.
His body moved on its own before his mind even had to think.
Kazama and Bo noticed immediately.
“…He’s gone.” Kazama said.
“…Bad luck for them.” Bo commented.

Shin Steps In
Ai was about to tell them off properly, but before she could—
A strong arm wrapped around her shoulders.
“Oi. You flirting with my girl?”
The voice was calm but sharp, like a blade barely unsheathed.
The guys flinched at the sudden presence.
Shin stood beside Ai, looking like a completely different person. His usual lazy, playful demeanor was gone—his eyes sharp, his expression unreadable.
Ai’s heart skipped a beat. He’s acting… cool?
The tallest guy scoffed. “Tch. You her boyfriend?”
Shin’s grip on Ai tightened ever so slightly.
“Yeah.”
Ai’s face exploded into red.
“H-Huh?!” She squeaked.
Shin ignored her reaction and took a step forward, his presence overwhelming.
“You guys done here?” He asked, voice dangerously low.
The air around them shifted.
It wasn’t just Shin’s height or build that made him intimidating—it was something deeper. A quiet confidence. A trained, controlled strength.
The lead guy tried to act tough.
“…What if we’re not?” He smirked.
Shin’s fingers twitched. A natural habit from his kendo training.
Then, in a single movement, he shifted his stance—not aggressively, but just enough for the guy to instinctively back up.
The guy’s body reacted before his brain did.
And that’s when he realized.
“…Shit. This guy’s dangerous.”
Shin smirked, noticing his hesitation. “Thought so.”
The second guy laughed nervously, grabbing his friend’s shoulder. “Dude, let’s just go. Not worth it.”
“…Tch.” The leader clicked his tongue but turned away. “Whatever. Not like we wanted her that bad.”
Big mistake.
Before Ai could say anything, Shin moved.
Not violently—just fast.
The guy suddenly found himself being pulled by his collar.
“Say that again?” Shin whispered, inches from his face.
The guy couldn’t breathe.
Ai’s eyes widened. This is the serious Shin that’s always hidden underneath…
The guy gulped. “…N-Nothing. We’re leaving.”
Shin held him for a second longer, then released him.
The three guys practically ran away.

Aftermath
Shin turned back to Ai.
She was staring at him. Hard.
“…You’re acting really cool right now,” she muttered.
Shin shrugged, returning to his usual lazy tone. “I just said what I had to.”
Ai puffed up her cheeks. “And what’s with calling me ‘your girl’?! You can’t just say things like that!”
Shin smirked. “Would you rather I left you with them?”
Ai froze.
“…You’re so unfair sometimes.”
Shin chuckled. “Let’s go back.”
As they walked back, Ai stole one more glance at him.
Her face was still warm.
“…Damn it. This is so unfair.”
You said:
after the heat of things the grp calmed down for bbq, during which they realised and saw each other bikini's and bodies (you know who saw whom, also ai is surprised to see shin being kinda ripped, though it is expected he is a kendo player).
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 150 – BBQ and… Body Checks?!
After the heat of the confrontation had settled, the group finally regrouped at their reserved BBQ area, which was set up just by the beach under a shaded pavilion. The sun had begun to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink as the smell of grilled meat and seafood filled the air.
Shin was at the grill, expertly flipping the skewers. Bo stood next to him, carefully arranging plates, while Kazama took charge of drinks. Meanwhile, the girls had taken a seat, chatting amongst themselves.
The moment was peaceful—until someone pointed it out.

The Realization
Akari, grinning mischievously, casually took a sip of her drink and let it drop.
“By the way… Now that I think about it, we all finally got to see each other’s beach bodies, huh?”
Silence.
Then—
“—!!”
The group froze, glancing at each other.
And that’s when they realized.
Everyone had seen everyone.

The Girls’ Side
Nene was suddenly hyper-aware that Masao had been right there during volleyball, and she had been jumping around in her swimsuit the whole time. Her face turned completely red.
Rika, in her usual calm tone, tapped a finger to her chin. “So you’re saying we should rate everyone?”
Masao almost choked on his drink. “Rate?! I’m not ready for this!”
Ai’s face twitched. She had been too focused on her teasing battle with Shin earlier, but now it hit her.
She had seen him shirtless.
And—
He was actually kinda…
“…Ripped.”
It made sense. He did Kendo. But Shin never acted like a ‘fit’ guy, so it completely threw her off.
“Wait.” Ai suddenly said. “Shin… You actually have muscles?”

The Boys’ Side
Shin, still tending the grill, glanced at her with a blank face. “What kind of reaction is that?”
Ai narrowed her eyes. “I just assumed you were all talk and no body.”
Shin sighed dramatically. “What do you take me for?”
Kazama coughed. “…Well, it is surprising. You never exactly flex it.”
Hayashi, who had been mostly observing, nodded. “It’s because his clothes are usually baggy. It hides it.”
Bo, who had always known, simply took a sip of his drink.
Meanwhile, Yasuo, the most blunt of the group, pointed straight at Nene.
“By the way, Nene, you’re actually kinda stacked.”
“Huh—?!”
Masao nearly fell off his chair.
“Y-Yasuo!! You can’t just say that!!”
Yasuo, completely unaffected, just shrugged. “What? It’s true.”
Nene, still processing what was just said, kicked him under the table.
“Ow.”

Ai’s Counterattack
Still caught up in her own thoughts, Ai squinted at Shin again.
And then—
A grin spread on her face.
“…So you’re actually hiding something under those clothes all this time?”
Shin, sensing danger, narrowed his eyes. “…What are you thinking?”
Ai stood up, stretched, then made her move.
In one swift motion, she reached forward and poked his stomach.
“Hoooh? That’s some solid abs.”
Shin flinched just slightly.
Ai grinned wider. “Ticklish?”
Shin immediately took a step back. “No.”
“Liar.”
Seeing an opportunity, the rest of the girls’ side joined in.
Akari: “Oh? Can I confirm?”
 Nene: “He did dodge fast.”
 Rika: “Science demands evidence.”
“Don’t start a science experiment on my abs.” Shin deadpanned.
Kazama and Masao just watched in amusement.

The Tables Turn
Feeling cornered, Shin turned the tables.
“…Then should I comment on your body too, Ai?”
Ai froze.
Shin smirked slightly, watching her expression.
Ai’s face turned red.
“…Tch. You win this time.” She muttered, quickly retreating.
The boys chuckled.
Bo, who had been eating his skewer in peace, simply commented, “The food’s getting cold.”
And with that, they finally returned to their BBQ, the tension shifting back to their usual fun chaos.
…But Ai definitely didn’t stop thinking about those abs.
You said:
after wards just before leaving they split into duos, for some quite time. shin and ai, masao and nene, kazama and hima (not before shin gave him a death stare), akari and minami, rika and bo. and yosuo and hayashi the 2 single boys were left behind.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 151 – Quiet Moments in Pairs
As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the beach, the group naturally split off into pairs, each heading in their own direction for a moment of quiet before leaving.
Some pairs were expected. Some were awkwardly thrown together. And two were left behind completely.
Yasuo and Hayashi stood in silence.
“…This is discrimination,” Hayashi muttered.
“…Yeah,” Yasuo sighed.
But the rest of the pairs? Their stories were just beginning.

Shin and Ai – The Unspoken Shift
Shin and Ai walked along the shoreline, the soft waves lapping at their feet.
Neither of them spoke right away. There was no teasing, no plotting—just silence.
And for once, Ai wasn’t sure how to break it.
It had been happening more often.
These moments where she wasn’t sure if she wanted to tease him or just… enjoy being with him.
Is it because of today? she wondered.
The volleyball game. The Kendo stance he took when stepping in for her. The way he looked different from how she always imagined.
And now, this quiet moment.
She snuck a glance at him. He looked unbothered, hands in his pockets, gazing at the waves.
“…You’re thinking too much,” he suddenly said.
Ai startled. “Huh?”
Shin glanced at her. “You keep looking at me, spacing out. Something on your mind?”
Ai quickly turned away. “Shut up.”
“…That’s not a no.”
“…Tch.” She kicked the water slightly, causing small splashes.
Then—
“…I just thought today was fun,” she admitted, voice softer than usual.
Shin looked at her.
The playful Ai, the one who always had a trick up her sleeve, was now just a girl, watching the waves.
Shin smirked. “Huh. You’re pretty honest today.”
“…I’ll drown you.”
They kept walking.
Neither of them wanted to go back yet.

Masao and Nene – The Almost Moment
Masao and Nene sat on a beachside bench, watching the horizon.
Masao fidgeted.
Nene sighed. “Stop squirming. It’s not like I’m gonna eat you.”
“…I-I’m just thinking.”
Nene turned to him. “…About?”
Masao gulped. “…Stuff.”
Nene raised an eyebrow. “Wow. So detailed.”
Masao, gathering all his courage, finally spoke.
“…I-it’s just… today was fun, right?”
Nene nodded. “Yeah.”
“…A-and we’ve been spending more time together, right?”
“…Yeah?”
Masao’s heart was beating like crazy.
He wasn’t gonna confess—he wasn’t that brave.
But this moment felt like it could be something.
So, he took a deep breath.
“…I like spending time with you.”
Silence.
Nene blinked.
Masao froze. Wait. WAIT. Did that sound like a confession?!
Nene stared at him for a long second—then smirked.
“Of course you do. I’m amazing.”
Masao almost collapsed in relief.
But—
Nene wasn’t laughing.
She didn’t tease him more.
She just let his words sit.
And Masao, despite the panic, felt weirdly happy.

Kazama and Hima – The Death Stare Incident
Kazama knew he was in danger the second he heard Shin inhale.
As he walked off with Hima, he felt it.
Shin’s glare.
Pure, unfiltered, older-brother energy burning into the back of his skull.
Kazama sighed. “Your brother is scary.”
Hima laughed. “He’s just being Shin-nii.”
“…I think he wants to kill me.”
“…Yeah, probably.”
“THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE.”
Hima just giggled.
They walked quietly for a bit, the night breeze cooling the sand.
Then, Hima spoke up.
“…Hey.”
Kazama turned. “Hm?”
She hesitated, then smiled. “Thanks for today.”
Kazama blinked. “For what?”
She pouted. “For helping me with my gift shopping. And for the test prep. And just… I dunno.”
She twirled a strand of hair. “It’s been fun.”
Kazama stared at her.
She was just a kid not that long ago. But now—she felt different.
“…Yeah,” he finally said. “It has been.”
And somehow, that felt like enough.

Akari & Minami – The Power Couple’s Escape
Akari dragged Minami away before anyone could question it.
“You just wanted time alone, huh?” Minami said.
Akari smirked. “Of course. I have priorities.”
Minami chuckled. “What a girlfriend.”
Akari beamed.
“Damn right.”

Rika and Bo – The Internal Crisis
Rika had no idea why she was nervous.
It’s just Bo. Just. Bo.
But after that moment earlier, where he caught her mid-fall so effortlessly, she hadn’t been able to unsee it.
So now—walking beside him in the cool night air—she was stressing.
Bo, meanwhile, was just vibing.
“…You’re quiet,” he finally said.
Rika jumped.
“…I’m always quiet.”
Bo looked at her.
“…No, you’re not.”
Rika froze.
Bo’s stare was calm as ever—but it saw through her.
Rika panicked internally.
I CAN’T LET HIM KNOW I’M THINKING ABOUT HIM IN A WEIRD WAY.
“…I-I was just thinking about a book I read recently.”
Bo blinked.
Then nodded. “Oh. Cool.”
Rika sighed in relief.
…But also felt weirdly disappointed.

The Abandoned Two
Back at the pavilion—
Hayashi and Yasuo sat alone.
Yasuo sighed. “We could’ve gone together, you know.”
Hayashi nodded. “Yeah.”
“…But that’d make it weird, right?”
“…Yeah.”
“…Wanna just go get ice cream?”
“…Yeah.”
And so, the forgotten duo went off into the night.

The End of a Long Day
Eventually, the group reunited, the night finally winding down.
But as they packed up and headed back, something felt different.
Unspoken shifts in dynamics. Quiet thoughts unshared.
Summer was still young.
And the group was changing.
You said:
after a few days we focus back into the nohara's residence during the summer, like old time.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 152 – A Classic Summer at the Noharas'
The sweltering heat of summer had settled in, and just like old times, the Nohara household became the center of chaotic yet oddly heartwarming family moments.

Morning Madness
Shin groaned as he rolled onto his stomach, face buried in his pillow.
“Mmm… It’s summer… It’s hot… Why do I have to be awake…”
From the other side of the room, a voice responded with way too much energy for the morning.
“Shin-nii, it’s already past ten! You’re wasting the best part of the day!”
Himawari stood by his bedside, arms crossed, dressed in her casual summer outfit, a light sundress that swayed as she shifted her weight.
Shin turned his face slightly, eyes half-open.
“…I have a great life hack for summer break.”
Himawari raised an eyebrow. “What?”
“…Sleep through it.”
Before she could retort, the door suddenly burst open.
“SHINNOSUKE! HIMAWARI! BREAKFAST—”
Misae’s yell was cut off as she saw her son still in bed, sprawled like a lazy cat.
A vein popped on her forehead.
“…I’ll give you five seconds.”
Shin sprang up.
“GOOD MORNING, BEAUTIFUL MOTHER! I WAS JUST DREAMING ABOUT YOU SERVING ME A DELICIOUS MEAL!”
Himawari sighed. “Ugh, you’re so fake.”
Misae didn’t buy it either. “Get downstairs. Now.”
And so, the morning began in the most Nohara way possible.

The Usual Summer Chaos
After breakfast, Shin flopped onto the floor, fan blasting directly at his face.
Himawari sat nearby, flipping through a magazine.
Hiroshi, sitting on the couch, had his shirt rolled up, beer in one hand, remote in the other.
Misae wiped sweat off her forehead, sighing. “I swear, summers are getting worse every year.”
Shin lazily turned his head. “Mom, don’t you think it’s kind of beautiful? How the heat makes us all appreciate life’s little moments?”
Misae squinted. “…Did you just call suffering ‘beautiful’?”
“…Maybe.”
Hiroshi laughed. “Shin, you’ve really mastered the art of not doing anything.”
Shin grinned. “I’m a professional.”
Himawari rolled her eyes. “Honestly, how have you survived this long?”
Before anyone could answer, the doorbell rang.

Unexpected Guests
Misae opened the door, and there stood Nene, Masao, Kazama, and Bo.
“We figured you’d all be suffering in the heat,” Kazama said, wiping sweat off his forehead.
“So we’re here to suffer with you,” Masao added.
“…That doesn’t sound like a good reason,” Misae muttered, stepping aside.
As soon as they entered, Himawari smirked.
“Well, well, well… Kazama-kun, visiting on a summer day? Interesting.”
Kazama froze. “Huh? It’s not—! I didn’t—!!”
Shin patted his shoulder. “Hima, don’t tease him too hard. His blood pressure can’t handle it.”
Kazama gritted his teeth. “Shut. Up.”
Misae watched them interact and sighed. “This house is getting louder by the second.”
Hiroshi just chuckled. “At least it keeps things lively.”

The Ultimate Summer Game: Water War
As the day dragged on, the group eventually moved to the backyard.
And that’s when the idea hit Shin.
“…It’s hot.”
Nene wiped her forehead. “Yeah?”
Shin’s eyes glinted mischievously. “We should do something about it.”
Five minutes later—
Misae screamed.
“WHY IS MY BACKYARD A WATER BATTLEFIELD?!”
Shin, already drenched, dodged as Kazama threw a water balloon at him.
“IT’S SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST, MOM!”
Bo, holding a bucket, poured an entire wave of water over Masao’s head.
Masao gasped for air. “B-Bo-chan… you betrayed me…”
Nene, completely dry, smirked as she dodged every attack with strategic movements.
“Pathetic. You all lack precision.”
Kazama, soaked, glared at her. “Nene, are you even playing?!”
“I play to win.”
“HOW?!!”
Himawari, teaming up with Bo, ambushed Shin from behind.
Shin turned at the last second—only to be met with a full water balloon to the face.
“…Betrayed by my own flesh and blood,” he gasped. “Et tu, Hima?”
Himawari just grinned.
Kazama tried to throw another one at Shin, but Shin ducked—and it hit Misae instead.
Everyone froze.
Misae slowly wiped water off her face.
“…I see.”
And thus, the true battle began.

The Aftermath
An hour later, the entire group collapsed onto the porch, exhausted and dripping.
Misae, despite being soaked, sighed and gave in.
“…Fine. That was fun.”
Shin smirked. “See? You just have to let go sometimes, Mom.”
Misae bonked him on the head.
“Let go of this.”
As the sun set, Hiroshi grilled some food, and the group chatted lazily, enjoying the summer evening.
It was one of those rare, simple days.
No school drama. No romance games. Just the old summer vibes from childhood.
And somehow, those were the best.

a week pass for ai without shin, and suddenly she receives a call from shin and he invited to the summer festival. she gets super excited only to realise as she reched there its not just the 2 but everyone is there(hima included).
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 153 – Summer Festival Surprise
The week had been… strange for Ai.
With the heat of summer in full swing, she had rarely seen Shin—which, if she was being honest, bothered her a lot more than she wanted to admit.
No teasing.
 No witty back-and-forth.
 No small moments where she tried to make him flustered.
She hated to admit it, but she missed him.
So, when her phone rang, and the name "Shin Nohara" flashed across the screen—
Her heart skipped a beat.

The Call
"Hello?" she answered, quickly clearing her throat to not sound too eager.
"Yo, Ai-chan."
She almost melted at the casual way he said her name.
But she quickly regained her composure. "What do you want, peasant?"
"Jeez, is that how you greet someone who's inviting you to a festival?"
Her eyes widened.
"A festival?"
"Yeah. The summer festival is tonight. Thought you might wanna come."
Ai felt her heart race.
A festival…?
 Him, inviting her…?
Was this a—
"DATE?!"
"You're taking responsibility if I come, right?" she asked, unable to hide her smirk.
"Eh? Responsibility?"
"You invited me, after all. That makes you my escort for the night."
"…That sounds expensive."
She laughed. "Too late now. I'll see you there, Shin-chan~"
She hung up, thrilled, already making plans for what to wear.
This was it.

Reality Hits Hard
Dressed in a stunning summer yukata—a beautiful mix of deep red and white with golden floral patterns—Ai arrived at the festival grounds with her heart pounding.
She scanned the area, searching for him.
Her lips curled into a small smile. This was going to be fun.
And then—
"AI-CHAN!"
She turned, grinning, ready to greet Shin—
—Only to see not just Shin, but… the whole group.
Himawari included.
Her smile twitched.
“…Oh.”
Shin walked up, hands in his pockets. "Hey, you made it."
Ai forced a smile. "Of course I did. You invited me, after all."
Masao waved. "Ai-chan, you look amazing!"
Nene nodded. "Yeah, your yukata suits you."
"Thank you," she replied automatically, but her mind was somewhere else.
This… wasn’t a date.
She had completely misunderstood.
Damn it, Shin…

Internal Screaming (ft. Ai Suotome)
As the group moved through the festival, Ai felt her excitement drop by at least 50%.
Shin, of course, was completely oblivious.
She snuck a glance at him. Even in a simple yukata, he looked good.
She had imagined so many scenarios:
A moment alone under the fireworks.
 Him getting flustered by how she looked.
 Maybe even… holding hands.
But now?
She was stuck in a group outing.
"Ai, control yourself. Do not commit murder."
"…No, but seriously, I might."
"Oi, Ai-chan, you good?" Shin suddenly asked, raising an eyebrow.
She snapped out of it.
"Of course," she said smoothly. "Why wouldn't I be?"
Shin just shrugged. "I dunno. You looked like you were planning world domination just now."
She let out a soft chuckle. "Maybe I am."

Festival Fun (But Not How Ai Wanted)
Despite her initial disappointment, the night still had its fun moments.
They visited food stalls, played festival games, and even ended up in a spirited goldfish scooping competition.
Kazama, ever the perfectionist, took it way too seriously.
"This is about skill," he muttered, eyes locked onto the water. "A true strategist knows—"
His paper scooper immediately broke.
Shin patted his shoulder. "Tough luck, buddy."
Ai, meanwhile, was plotting.
She needed to get Shin alone.

Fireworks and a Small Victory
As the night neared its end, the festival's grand fireworks display began.
The group found a spot near the shrine, where the night sky lit up with vibrant colors.
Amidst the oohs and aahs of the group, Ai saw her chance.
She nudged Shin slightly.
“Shin-chan.”
“Hm?”
“Come with me for a sec.”
Before he could question it, she grabbed his wrist and pulled him away from the group.
Success.

Finally, Just the Two of Them
They stopped by a quieter part of the festival grounds, where the fireworks still shone brightly above them.
Shin raised an eyebrow. “What’s up?”
Ai sighed, crossing her arms. “You really don’t get it, do you?”
He blinked. “Huh?”
She rolled her eyes, then looked directly at him.
"You invited me, Shin-chan."
"Yeah?"
"You didn't tell me everyone else was coming."
Shin scratched his cheek. "…I didn't think that part mattered?"
Ai let out a small laugh, shaking her head.
"Shin-chan," she started, leaning slightly closer, "if a guy invites a girl to a festival, alone, what do you think she assumes?"
Shin paused.
Then, slowly, realization dawned on his face.
“…Wait.”
She smirked.
“There it is,” she teased. "Took you long enough."
Shin opened his mouth—then closed it. Then opened it again.
“…Oh.”
Ai simply laughed.
She wasn’t that mad anymore.
At the very least, she got to see this rare expression on his face.
And somehow, that was a small victory.

the summer ends, minami and akari have graduated, the grps is in 3rd years and hima join high school fresher.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 154 – A New School Year Begins
Summer had come and gone.
The once lively and carefree days at the beach, the festivals, and the chaos of their group outings had now settled into a new reality.
The biggest change?
Akari and Minami had graduated.
Though it was expected, it still felt… strange.
The group dynamic had shifted.
And now, as the remaining students stepped into their third year of high school, something else had changed, too—
Himawari was now a first-year.

First Day Back
The air buzzed with the energy of a new school year.
Freshmen were nervously huddled together, second-years were sizing up their seniors, and third-years…
Well, they just felt old.
Shin yawned as he walked through the school gates, hands in his pockets.
Behind him, Kazama was mumbling about future plans, Nene was excitedly chatting with Rika, and Masao and Bo-chan were just taking in the atmosphere.
"So this is our last year, huh?" Masao mused.
"Technically, yes," Bo-chan responded in his usual calm tone.
Shin stretched. "Meh, doesn't feel that different."
"That's because you never stress about anything," Kazama muttered.
Shin smirked. "I prefer to live in the moment."
Kazama sighed, already regretting engaging in this conversation.
"Wait—look over there!" Nene suddenly said, pointing ahead.
The group turned towards the entrance—
And saw Himawari standing there in her brand-new first-year uniform.
Her hair was tied up neatly, her blazer was perfectly fitted, and…
She looked like she belonged here.
"Damn," Shin muttered. "She's actually a high schooler now."

Big Brother Mode (Activated?)
Himawari noticed them and walked over, a confident smile on her face.
"Good morning, everyone," she greeted.
"Yo, Hima," Shin said, ruffling her hair immediately.
"Ugh, Shin-nii, stop!" she groaned, swatting his hand away.
Kazama chuckled. "You're already causing problems on her first day."
Shin shrugged. "What kind of big brother would I be if I didn't?"
Nene smiled. "You look really good in the uniform, Himawari!"
Himawari beamed. "Thanks! I’ve been looking forward to high school for a long time."
Kazama gave a polite nod. "You'll do well here. Just make sure to study."
Shin snorted. "Pfft, nerd."
Kazama glared. "It's called being responsible, Shin."
"Yeah, yeah," Shin waved him off, then turned back to Himawari. "So, you nervous?"
Himawari crossed her arms. "Not at all."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "You sure? You’re a tiny first-year now."
"I'm not tiny!" she snapped.
Shin just laughed.
But even as they joked, there was something about this moment—
A realization.
His little sister was growing up.
And this was her world now, too.
You said:
the entire day, the grp pampared hima, and shin made it clear the first day the he was her brother, that was enough for the entire school. but the 1st year girl gushed over him which didnt sit wel with ai.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 155 – The First-Year Queen and Her Overprotective Brother
The first day of the new school year was always lively, but for Himawari, it was something else entirely.
The moment she stepped into the classroom, it was as if she had a royal entourage.
"Oh my god, you're so pretty!"
"Your hair is amazing! What do you use?"
"Wait, you’re Shin Nohara’s little sister?!"
By the time lunch rolled around, Himawari was already the unofficial queen of the first-years.

Big Brother in Action
Shin, on the other hand?
He made his presence known immediately.
At least once in every classroom, hallway, or stairwell, people heard:
"Oi, that’s my little sister."
"If anyone messes with her, tell me."
"She’s off-limits."
The first-years were stunned at how different Shin was from the rumors.
"Wait, isn’t he supposed to be a troublemaker?"
"Why does he sound so serious?"
"I heard he’s crazy good at Kendo too. Imagine if someone pisses him off—"
One bold first-year boy tried to introduce himself to Himawari, only for Shin to suddenly appear from behind and slap a hand on his shoulder.
"Ah, ah, ah," Shin said, shaking his head. "What do you want with my sister?"
The poor kid immediately backed away.
By the end of the day, Himawari’s reputation was set in stone.
She was gorgeous, smart, confident—and completely protected.

Ai’s Mood? Ruined.
Meanwhile…
Ai had her own problems.
The first-year girls had caught wind of Shin’s name—
And they were swooning.
"Wait, the student council president is that guy?!"
"I thought he’d be nerdy, but he’s so cool-looking!"
"He's even taller than I expected… and kind of… ripped?"
"You think he has a girlfriend?"
Ai twitched.
This was not okay.
She knew Shin was popular in their own grade, but first-years too?!
She glanced at him—Shin was completely oblivious, lazily stretching as if he hadn’t just gained a fan club.
Ai gritted her teeth.
"This school year is going to be a problem."
You said:
contiune with the day.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 156 – The First Day Continues: Chaos Ensues
Lunch Break – The First-Year Girls Attack
By the time lunch break arrived, Shin unknowingly had a fan club.
The first-year girls wasted no time in trying to get closer.
As soon as Shin and the group sat down at their usual spot, a few nervous but determined first-years walked up.
"Excuse me, Senpai!" one of them blurted out.
Shin, in the middle of eating, blinked at them. "Hm?"
"U-Um… Can we sit with you?"
Before Shin could even react—
Ai slammed her chopsticks on the table.
"No."
The girls flinched.
Ai smiled sweetly, but her aura was anything but friendly.
"He's already got a table. Try again next year."
Shin, Kazama, and the boys just stared.
Nene looked way too entertained.
Masao nervously whispered to Bo, "Should we stop her?"
Bo shook his head. "It’s already too late."
The first-years retreated, whispering among themselves.
"She's scary!"
"Who is she?!"
"Wait, is she his girlfriend?!"
Ai stiffened at that last part.
But before she could recover, Shin just shrugged.
"Don’t mind them. First-years get over things quickly."
Ai narrowed her eyes.
"Shin. They were trying to flirt with you."
Shin tilted his head. "Were they?"
Ai inhaled deeply. "You’re a lost cause."

Himawari’s Classroom – The Chaos Continues
Meanwhile, in Himawari’s class…
She was trying to enjoy a peaceful lunch, but the boys in her class had other plans.
"Hey, Himawari-chan, are you free after school?"
"I heard there's a café near the station. Want to go together?"
"You like movies? I know a great one playing this weekend!"
Before Himawari could even react—
A deep voice interrupted.
"Oi."
The boys froze.
Shin stood at the doorway.
"Hima, let’s go," he said, as if he hadn’t just sent every guy in the room into a panic.
"Wait, wait, Nohara-senpai! We were just—"
"Don’t care."
"But we were just talking!"
"Don’t care."
Shin barely spared them a glance before grabbing Himawari’s lunch box and walking off with it.
Himawari sighed, shaking her head. "See you later, boys."
She followed after her brother, leaving behind a devastated group of classmates.

After School – The Incident
As the school day ended, Himawari finally had enough.
"Shin," she huffed, walking beside him. "You're being too overprotective."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "I’m just watching out for you."
"Yeah, but you scared every guy in my class!"
"Good. That means they’ll stay away."
Himawari groaned. "What if I actually like someone?"
Shin stopped walking.
Slowly, he turned to face her.
"Hima. Who?"
Himawari blinked. "What?"
"Who do you like?"
"I—That’s not what I meant!"
Shin crossed his arms. "It better not be someone like Kazama."
At that, Himawari’s face exploded red.
"WHY WOULD YOU BRING UP KAZAMA?!"
Shin narrowed his eyes. Suspicious.
Before he could press further, Kazama himself appeared.
"Oh, Nohara. Himawari."
Himawari visibly panicked.
Shin squinted at her reaction.
"Why do you look so guilty?"
"I DON’T."
Kazama raised an eyebrow. "Did something happen?"
Shin suddenly smirked. "You tell me, Kazama."
Kazama frowned. "Huh?"
Himawari dragged Shin away before he could say another word.
"WE'RE LEAVING. GOODBYE, KAZAMA."
Kazama just stood there, confused. "…What just happened?"

The End of the Day – Ai's Revenge
Back at the school gate, Ai was still mad.
She wasn’t jealous.
Nope.
Not at all.
It’s just—why was Shin so oblivious?!
So, she decided.
It was time for payback.
As Shin stretched, yawning, Ai suddenly looped her arm around his.
"Hmm," she said loudly, leaning in. "You know, Shin, I think we should spend more time together~"
Shin froze.
The first-year girls at the gate gasped.
"SEE? THEY’RE DATING!!"
Shin slowly turned to Ai.
"Oi. What the hell are you doing?"
Ai smiled innocently. "What? I can’t walk with you?"
"You can let go of my arm."
"Nope~"
Shin sighed.
Kazama walked past them, shaking his head. "Serves you right."
Shin glared at him.
And that’s how the first day of third-year ended—with chaos, overprotectiveness, misunderstandings, and one very smug Ai-chan.
You said:
the days goes by, what do we have here a new student council president to be elected. the grp get the news of it the first thing on the day in the office. the grp thought it will be an easy win for them this time too with shin becoming the president again. but rumors start to spread and news is heard by them at lunch that hima is the also running for the position.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 157 – The Student Council Election Begins: Shin vs. Hima?!

Morning – A New Election Begins
It was just another normal day… or so they thought.
The student council room was as chaotic as ever. Papers everywhere, documents half-filled, and Kazama already looking like he aged ten years.
"Shin, can you at least pretend to take this job seriously?" Kazama grumbled, stacking documents neatly.
Shin, lounging on the couch, barely spared him a glance.
"I did my job already. The event proposals are signed, the budgets are approved, and I wrote a speech for you to read at the opening ceremony."
Kazama stared at him. "Wait, you wrote a speech?"
Shin smirked. "No, but you looked excited for a second."
Kazama twitched violently.
Before he could throw a clipboard at Shin's head, the student council advisor walked in.
"I have an announcement," the teacher said, adjusting his glasses.
Everyone looked up.
"The Student Council Presidential Election is coming up. As you all know, every year, the president must either step down or be re-elected. This time, it will be an open election—any third-year can run for president, including students outside of the council."
The room fell silent.
Then—
"Wait," Masao said slowly. "That means—"
"Shin needs to run again," Ai finished, looking over at him.
Shin blinked. "Huh. Neat."
Nene crossed her arms. "This should be easy. I mean, no one else is gonna win against him, right?"
Just as she said that—
The door suddenly burst open.
A student ran inside, out of breath.
"GUYS! Have you heard the news?!"
Kazama frowned. "What news?"
The student panted. "Someone else is running for president!"
Shin yawned. "Yeah, yeah, people run every year. I’ll win anyway."
"NO, NO, YOU DON’T GET IT."
The student took a deep breath—
"YOUR OPPONENT IS HIMAWARI NOHARA."
Silence.
A chair scraped against the floor as Kazama nearly fell over.
Nene dropped her pen.
Masao choked on his juice box.
Bo raised an eyebrow.
Ai's eyes widened. "Wait—what?!"
Everyone turned to Shin.
Shin just… stared.
Then—
"Huh?"

Lunch Break – The Battle Begins
By lunchtime, the entire school was talking about it.
"Himawari is running against her own brother?!"
"I heard she’s serious about winning!"
"She has a huge fanbase in the first-years, this might be a real competition!"
The student council members sat together, processing the news.
Shin, completely unbothered, ate his lunch.
Kazama, on the other hand, looked like he was about to explode.
"WHY ISN’T THIS BOTHERING YOU?!"
Shin shrugged. "Why would it?"
"BECAUSE YOUR OWN SISTER IS TRYING TO TAKE YOUR JOB!"
"Less work for me if she wins."
Kazama twitched. "THAT’S NOT THE POINT."
Meanwhile, Ai was deep in thought.
"Honestly… Hima could have a real shot at this."
Nene nodded. "Yeah, she’s popular with the younger students. A lot of first-years really look up to her."
Masao gulped. "And if she has first-year support, that’s a huge advantage."
Kazama shook his head. "No way. Shin is way more experienced."
"But he’s also lazy," Ai pointed out.
Shin smirked. "You wound me."
Kazama ignored him. "It doesn’t matter. This is an open election. The only way Himawari wins is if she somehow gathers more votes than the entire student council and upperclassmen."
Bo finally spoke. "She might actually pull it off."
Everyone stared at him.
Bo simply nodded. "She’s a Nohara."
The entire group shuddered.
He was right.
If anyone could pull off an impossible victory, it was a Nohara.

Meanwhile – Himawari’s Side
Across the school, Himawari was already gathering support.
Her friend Riko clapped her hands together. "Okay! We need campaign posters, speeches, and a strategy!"
Himawari smiled. "It’s not just about winning. I want to make changes in the school too!"
Another first-year nodded. "If you win, it’ll be the first time a first-year-supported candidate takes the presidency!"
Himawari nodded confidently.
She wasn’t just running for fun.
She wanted to beat her brother.
For years, she had been "Shin-chan’s little sister."
This time?
She wanted to step out of his shadow.

After School – The Confrontation
As students left the building, Shin finally ran into Himawari.
She smirked. "So, you heard?"
Shin yawned. "Yeah. You’re really gonna run against me?"
"Why not?" Himawari crossed her arms. "I’m tired of people calling me ‘Shin-chan’s sister.’ I want to be known for my own achievements."
Shin scratched the back of his head. "You know I don’t really care about this whole ‘president’ thing, right?"
"That’s exactly why I want to win," Himawari said. "If you don’t care, then let me have it."
Shin smirked. "That’s not how it works. If you wanna beat me, you’ll have to earn it."
Himawari’s eyes sparkled with determination.
"Fine." She extended her hand. "May the best Nohara win."
Shin shook her hand.
And just like that—
The Nohara Sibling Election War had begun.

Chapter 158 – The Nohara Showdown: When Shin Gets Serious

Morning – Shin’s Competitive Side Awakens
For most of the third years, this election was just another event in the school year.
For Shinnosuke Nohara… it was war.
Sitting in the student council room, Shin tapped his fingers on the desk, an uncharacteristic smirk on his face.
Kazama, who had known Shin his entire life, immediately sensed something was off.
"Wait… why do you look… excited?" Kazama asked cautiously.
Shin’s smirk widened. "Because I finally have a real challenge."
Kazama blinked. "Didn’t you find last year’s election fun?"
"Nah." Shin waved his hand. "It was too easy. The competition was weak, and I barely had to do anything."
Ai tilted her head. "So, what’s different now?"
Shin grinned.
"It’s Hima."
The room fell silent.
Shin leaned back, looking completely relaxed—but his eyes sparkled with something rare.
A real fight.
A true opponent.
And most importantly…
"She’s strong," he admitted. "She’s got a huge following, she’s actually working hard for it, and let’s be real—she’s a Nohara."
Masao gulped. "And what does that mean?"
Shin’s smirk deepened.
"It means if I don’t go all out, I’ll actually lose."
Kazama’s entire body tensed. "Oh god."
Nene’s eyes widened. "Wait… does that mean…?"
Shin stood up.
"I’m gonna take this election seriously."
The room collectively gasped.
Bo simply nodded. "It’s over for her."

Himawari’s Campaign – The Rising Star
Meanwhile, across the school, Himawari’s campaign was booming.
She stood in front of the first-years, her voice confident and clear.
"Our school needs a fresh perspective! We need someone who understands the struggles of every student, not just the ones in power!"
The first-years cheered.
One student whispered, "She’s amazing!"
Another nodded. "And she’s super cute!"
Her campaign team worked tirelessly—passing out flyers, making banners, and winning over the students one by one.
"I won’t lie," Riko said. "Shin is a powerhouse. But if we gather enough support, we can actually beat him!"
Himawari smiled confidently.
"This isn’t just about winning."
She clenched her fist.
"This is about proving I can stand on my own, without being ‘Shin-chan’s sister.’"
But what she didn’t know…
Shin had already started moving.

The Shift – Shin’s Campaign Begins
By lunchtime, the school was buzzing.
And then—
A group of second and third-years gathered in the courtyard.
There, sitting on top of a table like some charismatic rebel leader—
Was Shinnosuke Nohara.
"You guys know me," he began, his voice calm, lazy, but undeniably powerful. "I don’t usually care about things like this."
The students nodded.
"But this time?"
He leaned forward, his grin sharp.
"I actually want to win."
Silence.
Then—
The crowd exploded.
"OH SHIT, HE’S SERIOUS?!"
"If Shin is actually trying, doesn’t that mean he’ll just destroy everyone?"
"I mean, have you seen him in Kendo? When he gets serious, he’s a monster!"
"But Himawari is strong too!"
Shin held up a hand. The crowd immediately quieted.
"Listen," he said. "Hima’s great. She’s my sister, and I respect her hustle."
Then, his eyes gleamed.
"But if she thinks I’m gonna let her take my throne that easily—"
He grinned wickedly.
"—She’s got another thing coming."
The entire third-year section roared in support.
"THAT’S THE SHIN WE KNOW!!"
"THE KING IS BACK!!"
Kazama watched from afar, his face pale.
"…This is terrifying."
Ai, standing beside him, hid a smile.
"This is going to be fun."

Afternoon – The Showdown
By the time classes ended, the entire school had split into two factions.
The First-Year Army: Fully supporting Himawari


The Veteran Supporters: Rallying behind Shin


The hallways were filled with banners, posters, and campaign flyers.
It felt less like a school election and more like a warzone.
And at the center of it all—
Two Noharas.
Standing face to face.
Himawari smiled. "So, you’re actually gonna try, huh?"
Shin cracked his knuckles. "Wouldn’t be fun if I didn’t."
Himawari’s eyes burned with determination.
Shin’s grin sharpened.
And with that—
The Election War officially began.
You said:
they campening continued with student with teachers, but shin continued to glare students that came a bit too close to hima.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 159 – The Nohara Election War Rages On

Campaign Blitz: Students and Teachers Alike
The election war had reached full throttle.
Every hallway, every classroom, every available surface had campaign posters plastered across it.
"Vote Himawari – A Fresh Perspective for the Future!"


"Shinnosuke – Because We All Know Who’s Really in Charge."


Both sides worked relentlessly.
Himawari's team—mainly first-years—pushed an energetic, modern campaign. Social media posts, digital posters, and even a campaign website.
Shin’s supporters, however, were smarter.
They didn’t need to push too hard.
Because everyone already knew what Shin was capable of.
Instead of flashy tactics, they focused on reputation.
"Who handled the sports festival last year?" Shin.


"Who made sure the school festival didn’t turn into chaos?" Shin.


"Who has been running the school behind the scenes for two years?" Shin.


And the most powerful campaign argument?
"If he wins again, we won’t have to do anything."
…which was surprisingly persuasive to the lazy student body.

The Shin Problem: The Overprotective Big Brother
But while the campaigns raged on, there was another issue.
Shinnosuke Nohara was losing his mind.
It wasn’t because of his campaign.
It was because of the people helping Himawari’s campaign.
Specifically—
The male students.
"Oh my god, Himawari-chan! You’re amazing!"
"We’ll make sure you win!"
"Hima-chan, do you need anything? Water? Snacks? My heart?"
Shin sat in the student council room, watching the chaos unfold through the open window.
His eyes narrowed.
His jaw clenched.
Then—
"Oi."
The group of first-year boys froze.
Slowly, they turned to see Shin standing there, leaning against the window frame, his arms crossed.
His expression was calm.
Too calm.
Dangerously calm.
"…Senpai," one of the boys gulped.
Shin’s eyes glowed with menace.
"Why are you all so close to my sister?"
Silence.
Then—
One of the braver first-years tried to recover. "W-We’re just helping with the campaign—"
Shin’s glare intensified.
"Helping?"
The boy stepped back instinctively.
Then, before anyone could react—
Shin picked up a nearby baseball from a random sports club bin.
And threw it.
With perfect precision, the ball whizzed past the first-year boy’s head, grazing his hair before slamming into a wall behind him.
THWACK.
The group went pale.
Shin cracked his knuckles.
"I appreciate your enthusiasm," he said calmly.
"But if you get any closer to my sister—"
He smiled.
It was not a nice smile.
"—I can’t guarantee your safety."
The first-years ran for their lives.

Himawari’s Response
Later that afternoon, Himawari stormed into the student council room.
"Shin-chan!" she yelled.
Shin, casually sipping his juice box, looked up. "Hm?"
She slammed her hands on the desk. "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"
Shin blinked. "Running my campaign."
"NO! You’re SCARING AWAY MY SUPPORTERS!"
Shin paused. Then shrugged.
"If they scare that easily, they weren’t very useful, were they?"
"THAT’S NOT THE POINT!"
Himawari pointed a finger at him. "You’re not running for Dictator of Japan! You’re running for student council president!"
"Same thing," Shin muttered.
Kazama sighed. "No, it’s not."
"Close enough."
Himawari groaned in frustration. "You are IMPOSSIBLE!"
Shin grinned. "I know."

The Teachers Get Involved
Eventually, the faculty members noticed the insanity of the election.
At a teacher’s meeting, the staff discussed the chaos.
"The students are getting too heated about this election."
"The school feels like it’s in the middle of a civil war."
"It’s those two Noharas. They’ve turned the election into a battle for dominance."
The teachers sighed.
"We need to calm things down before this escalates."
And that’s when the real challenge appeared.
The school principal called both Shin and Himawari to his office.
"As much as I admire your passion," he said, rubbing his temples, "this election is out of control."
Shin and Hima exchanged looks.
"We’re just playing by the rules," Himawari said innocently.
Shin nodded. "Yeah. We’re just using what we have."
The principal sighed deeply.
"You two are more alike than you think," he muttered.
Himawari stiffened. "Take that back."
Shin snorted. "Yeah, I’m way cooler."
Himawari glared.
The principal rubbed his forehead.
"Listen. If you two don’t get your campaigns under control, we’re going to have to intervene."
Shin leaned forward, smirking. "And if we behave?"
The principal sighed. "Then the election continues as normal."
Shin leaned back. "Got it."
Himawari crossed her arms. "Fine."
As they left the office, Himawari turned to Shin.
"You’re playing dirty," she accused.
Shin just smiled.
"I’m playing to win."
Himawari narrowed her eyes.
"Then I’ll just have to beat you."
Shin grinned.
"I’d like to see you try."
And with that—
The election war entered its final stage.
You said:
then next day the same things contnued with hima, so in a dramtic and hilarious manner, shin gave his role of protecting hima to kazama, which played into it for a few seconds only to realise the absurdity with which shin was talking. it all happened in the office.

Chapter 160 – The New Bodyguard

The Chaos Continues
The day after the principal’s warning, the election madness continued.
Despite everything, Himawari's campaign remained strong.
Her team of first-years were working hard, gathering more votes, and appealing to the students who wanted change.
Meanwhile, Shin’s campaign was effortless.
His presence alone made people vote for him.
But while the election was progressing, Shin had a different problem.
More guys were still getting too close to Himawari.
This was unacceptable.

A Dramatic Declaration in the Student Council Office
During lunch, the entire friend group had gathered in the student council office.
As usual, Kazama sat at his usual spot, flipping through his notebook. Ai and Nene were chatting in the corner, and Bo-chan was eating his lunch in perfect silence.
Masao, however, was watching Shin with caution.
Because Shin…
…was pacing.
Heavily.
"Uhh…" Masao hesitated. "What’s wrong, Shin?"
Shin stopped pacing and let out a deep sigh.
Then, dramatically, he turned toward Kazama.
Kazama, who had just taken a sip of his tea, raised an eyebrow.
"What?"
Shin pointed at him.
"Kazama."
Kazama sighed. "What now?"
Then, suddenly—
Shin got down on one knee.
Everyone in the room froze.
"…What the hell?" Kazama said flatly.
Shin took a deep breath.
"I have come to a decision."
Ai, wide-eyed, whispered, "Is he about to propose?"
Nene smacked her. "Why would he propose to Kazama?!"
Kazama, meanwhile, rubbed his temples. "Shin… just say it."
Shin looked up at Kazama, his expression serious.
"As the current student council president…" He paused for dramatic effect.
Then—
"I am passing down my sacred duty."
Kazama stared at him. "…What?"
Shin stood up dramatically.
"From this day forward, you…
…are Himawari’s official bodyguard."
Silence.
Complete, utter silence.
Then—
"PFFT—" Masao choked on his juice.
Bo’s eyebrows raised slightly.
Ai burst out laughing.
Kazama, however—
Kazama’s brain short-circuited.
"Excuse me, what?"
Shin nodded solemnly. "I can’t keep my eyes on her all the time. And I can’t keep scaring away every guy who gets close to her."
"…Then stop doing that," Kazama muttered.
Shin ignored him.
"Which is why…"
He placed a hand on Kazama’s shoulder.
"I entrust this duty to you."
Kazama blinked. "You’re joking."
Shin shook his head.
"This is a serious matter."
"You want me to… guard your sister?"
"Yes."
Kazama stared at him.
For a moment, he actually considered it.
Then—
Reality hit.
"Wait, WHY am I even thinking about this?!"
He shoved Shin’s hand away.
"This is ABSURD! I am NOT your personal bodyguard!"
Shin sighed dramatically. "I thought you’d understand…"
Kazama groaned. "I swear, every day with you shortens my lifespan."
Ai, wiping tears from laughing too hard, leaned toward Himawari.
"Hey, how do you feel about this?"
Himawari, completely unbothered, took a sip of her tea.
"It’s Shin-nii. I expect nonsense."
Kazama turned to her. "And YOU’RE okay with this?!"
Himawari shrugged. "I mean, Kazama-kun’s always around anyway. Might as well make it official."
Kazama felt his soul leave his body.
"Not you too," he whispered.

The Aftermath
By the end of the day, the entire school knew.
Somehow, the rumors had spread.
"Kazama’s Himawari’s official bodyguard now?"


"Is that like… an actual position?"


"Wait, does that mean he’s closer to her than we are?"


"…How do I apply?"


Kazama, dragging himself to his desk, felt a migraine coming.
Meanwhile, Shin looked satisfied.
Mission accomplished.
You said:
the pinicale of the election, the speech and debate, much more hilarious this time, there are 2 nohara's to handle.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 161 – The Nohara Election Showdown

The Pinnacle of the Election – The Speech and Debate
The moment had arrived.
The final showdown between the two Noharas.
The election hall was filled with students buzzing with excitement.
This year’s Student Council Presidential Debate was going to be special—because for the first time ever, two siblings were competing for the title.
On one side stood Shinnosuke Nohara—the current president, known for his bizarre leadership, absurd charisma, and overwhelming influence.
On the other side stood Himawari Nohara—the rising star, the fresh challenger, and the only one brave enough to challenge her own brother.
It was about to be legendary.

Opening Statements
The host, a nervous-looking third-year, cleared his throat.
“Welcome, everyone, to the final stage of the election! The two candidates will now give their opening statements.”
Shin leaned against the podium, grinning.
“Ladies and gentlemen… and Kazama.”
Kazama sighed. "Why am I always singled out?"
Shin ignored him.
“This school has known great leadership under me! Under my rule—”
“Administration.” Kazama corrected.
Shin waved him off. “—Under my rule, we have seen a golden age of productivity and nonsense.”
Nonsense? Did he just say that out loud?
“But now,” Shin continued, “an enemy has risen.”
He turned dramatically to Himawari.
“A challenger. A force I have known since birth.”
Himawari rolled her eyes.
Shin pointed at her.
“She is cute, she is deadly, and she steals my pudding from the fridge!”
Gasps from the audience.
Himawari gasped too. “Shin-nii! That’s slander!”
“It’s the truth!”
“PROVE IT!”
“I WOULD—BUT I DON’T HAVE A CAMERA IN THE FRIDGE.”
Laughter exploded in the crowd.
The host wiped his face in exhaustion. "Can we… can we please continue?"
Shin nodded. “Fine, fine. In conclusion—vote for me. Or I might have to start remembering your names, and we don’t want that.”
More laughter.
Himawari sighed deeply, then took the mic.
She smiled sweetly.
"Good afternoon, everyone."
Unlike Shin’s chaotic energy, Himawari’s voice was smooth and controlled.
"As many of you know, I am Himawari Nohara. And yes, I am running against my ridiculous older brother."
The crowd chuckled.
"And while I respect him…"
She turned to him.
“…I also strongly believe that this school deserves an actual president.”
Gasps.
Shin put a hand to his heart. “That hurt.”
Himawari ignored him.
"I believe in progress, in structure, and in a future where the student council is not being run like a comedy show!"
The students cheered.
Shin faked a yawn.
"Booooring~."
Himawari smirked. "We’ll see about that, Shin-nii."

The Debate Round
The host took the mic again.
"And now, we move to the debate segment! The candidates will answer student-submitted questions."
He picked up a card.
"First question: What will you do to improve club funding?"
Himawari spoke first.
"We will set up a fair system where clubs receive funding based on their needs and performance. We will also introduce fundraisers to support clubs that require extra resources!"
The students nodded. Solid answer.
Then Shin took the mic.
“…Bribe the principal.”
Dead silence.
Kazama buried his face in his hands. “Shin, NO—”
Shin continued, completely serious.
"I mean, he’s a nice guy. Give him some ramen coupons, maybe a box of sweets. Boom. Funding."
Chaos. The crowd went wild.
Himawari grabbed the mic. "THAT’S ILLEGAL."
Shin shrugged. "Is it?"
Kazama whispered, "YES, IT IS."

The Closing Showdown
After several more questions, the debate came to an end.
The host sighed. "Final statements."
Himawari went first.
She stood tall.
"Vote for me, and I will bring structure, progress, and true leadership to this school!"
She looked around.
"Let’s move forward together!"
The students cheered.
Then Shin grabbed the mic.
"You all know me."
He spread his arms wide.
"You know what I stand for. You know what I do."
Dramatic pause.
"And if you vote for me…"
Another pause.
"I promise… MORE FIELD TRIPS."
The entire hall erupted.
Students screamed, “VOTE FOR SHINNOSUKE!”
Himawari gasped. "THAT’S NOT FAIR!"
Shin leaned into the mic.
"…Life isn’t fair, Hima."
And with that—
The debate ended.
You said:
as the day ended the 2 of them were going home, shin asked, looking at his presious sis, if she really wanted to become the president, he can drop out.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 162 – A Nohara Conversation
The day had finally ended.
The intense debate, the cheers, the absurdity of Shin’s campaign promises—it was all over.
Now, the two Noharas walked home together, the sky painted in deep orange as the sun dipped beyond the horizon. The streets were quiet except for the occasional rustling of leaves in the evening breeze.
Himawari was surprisingly silent. Usually, she would talk about everything at school, but now she just walked beside her brother, deep in thought.
Shin, hands stuffed in his pockets, glanced at her.
“…So?”
Himawari looked up. “So… what?”
Shin gave a lazy shrug. “Do you really wanna be the Student Council President?”
She blinked, caught off guard. “Of course I do! That’s why I ran for it.”
Shin smirked. “I mean, yeah, but like… do you really want it? ‘Cause if you do, I can just drop out.”
Himawari stopped walking.
“…What?”
Shin turned to her, the usual mischief absent from his face. For once, he was serious.
“If you really want it, I’ll let you have it. I don’t mind.”
Himawari stared at him. Her big brother, the guy who was usually impossible to read, was actually offering her the presidency.
For a second, she felt a twinge of guilt.
She knew that Shin loved being the President in his own weird way. He never admitted it, but she had seen it—how he handled student problems, how he had fun with the council, how he actually put in the effort despite his chaotic nature.
If he was willing to give it up for her… it meant he really cared.
But—
“No.”
Shin raised an eyebrow.
Himawari smiled, hands on her hips.
“I’m not taking it just because you handed it to me.”
Shin chuckled. “So stubborn.”
“That’s your fault.”
“Hey, I take pride in it.”
She crossed her arms. “I’m gonna win it fair and square.”
Shin grinned. “Heh. Now that’s my little sister.”
They started walking again.
After a few moments, Himawari spoke softly.
“…But thanks, Shin-nii.”
Shin ruffled her hair. “Don’t mention it.”
And with that, the Nohara siblings walked home, side by side, ready for whatever came next.
You said:
the election happened, with organiser of the election being the grp running for the presidency.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 163 – Election Day Chaos
The long-anticipated Student Council Presidential Election was finally here.
And ironically, the ones running for president—Shin and Himawari—were also the ones responsible for organizing it.
The absurdity wasn’t lost on them.
“This is so stupid,” Kazama muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“I know, right?” Shin leaned back in his chair, arms behind his head. “We have to organize an election where we are the main candidates. Talk about rigged.”
Himawari scoffed, sitting across from him at the Student Council table. “You’re just saying that because you’re scared I’ll win.”
Shin grinned. “Oh? You think you can beat your big bro?”
“Easily.”
The others—Kazama, Ai, Nene, Masao, Bo, Rika, Hayashi, and Yasuo—watched with varying levels of amusement and exhaustion.
“Alright, enough!” Ai clapped her hands together, trying to restore order. “We need to go over the final preparations.”
“Yeah.” Kazama cleared his throat. “We have the ballot system ready, the speeches scheduled, and the voting booths set up.”
“Who’s in charge of counting the votes?” Masao asked.
“I volunteered,” Bo said.
Nene immediately looked suspicious. “Wait, you don’t have a reason to rig it for either of them, right?”
Bo tilted his head. “Why would I do that?”
“Fair enough,” Ai sighed.
Meanwhile, Shin and Himawari were still exchanging competitive glares.
“Are we seriously letting these two handle leadership?” Yasuo whispered to Hayashi.
Hayashi shrugged. “Honestly? I just wanna see how this plays out.”
The morning passed in chaos, with last-minute poster placements, speech rehearsals, and student body complaints.
By lunchtime, the entire school was buzzing.
“Who do you think will win?”
“The great Shin Nohara has never lost!”
“But Himawari is just as crazy as him! Maybe even worse!”
“They’re siblings! What kind of election is this?!”
By the time the election event officially started, the entire school had gathered in the gymnasium, eager to see what would unfold.
And considering who was running, it was guaranteed to be a spectacle.
You said:
the vote are in, and this time they are annoucing the result by the end of the day, due to bo counting it too fast.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 164 – And the Winner Is…?
The voting had concluded way earlier than expected.
Thanks to Bo’s ridiculously fast counting skills, the results were ready by lunchtime, but the official announcement would be made at the end of the day to maintain the illusion of suspense.
Shin and Himawari, however, were anything but calm.

Lunch Break – The Student Council Office
Shin leaned back in his chair, tossing a stress ball in the air. “So, what do you think, Hima? Should I start writing my victory speech?”
Himawari rolled her eyes. “You mean my victory speech?”
Kazama, Ai, and the rest of the group sat around them, completely drained from witnessing nonstop sibling banter for the past week.
“We should’ve just let them fight it out in Kendo,” Masao muttered.
“That would’ve been less painful,” Rika agreed.
“I still don’t get how Bo counted the votes so fast,” Yasuo commented.
Bo blinked. “I just looked at the ballots and—”
“Don’t tell us!” Ai shouted, cutting him off.
The whole point of an election was the suspense!

Afternoon – Random Hallway Encounters
As the hours dragged on, the entire school was buzzing with speculation.
“Who do you think won?”
“Shin’s popular, but Hima’s terrifying.”
“She’s cute, but she’s also… Shin’s sister.”
“That makes her worse.”
“I voted for the lesser evil.”
“So, you voted for neither?”
“Exactly.”
Even the teachers were getting involved in the debates.

Final Period – The Announcement
The entire school gathered in the gymnasium once again. The stage was set, the tension was high, and all eyes were on Bo, the vote counter, as he walked up to the mic with the envelope in hand.
“The results… are in.”
A collective hush fell over the students.
Shin grinned, glancing at his sister. “Ready to bow down, Hima?”
Himawari smirked. “Right back at you, Onii-chan.”
Bo opened the envelope.
He stared at it.
Then he stared at it some more.
Then he frowned.
“…Huh.”
The room leaned in.
“…Uh, so… the winner of the Student Council Presidential Election is…”
Bo paused.
Everyone waited.
Bo blinked.
Then…
“It’s… a tie.”
Silence.
Complete and utter silence.
Then—
“WHAT?!” Shin and Himawari shouted in unison.
The gym exploded into chaos.
You said:
the chaos ensues, and there is still no solution.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 165 – The Battle of the Noharas Continues
Chaos. Absolute chaos.
The second Bo announced a tie, the entire school lost its mind.
“HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!” someone screamed.
“Did we just witness democracy breaking?!”
“What do we do now?! DO WE HAVE TWO PRESIDENTS?!”
Students were either shouting in disbelief, cheering for the chaos, or arguing over who deserved to win more.

On Stage – The Sibling Showdown
Shin crossed his arms and looked at Bo. “Are you sure you counted right?”
Bo nodded. “Yeah.”
Himawari groaned. “Then count again.”
“I did.”
Kazama stepped up. “How many votes did they get?”
Bo looked at the paper. “Uh… Shin got 386 votes… and Hima got 386 votes.”
“AND THEN?!” Ai asked impatiently.
Bo blinked. “That’s it. It’s a tie.”
Silence.
Then:
“DOESN’T THE COUNCIL HAVE A TIEBREAKER SYSTEM?!” Nene yelled.
The teachers exchanged awkward glances.
“…We never planned for this.”
“WHO DOESN’T PLAN FOR THIS?!” Masao cried.

The Debate Begins – Solutions That Lead to More Problems
Now the entire school was trying to figure out how to resolve the tie.
Proposal 1: Revote
 Kazama: “We could hold another vote tomorrow.”
 Shin: “Nope. I’m not going through another campaign. My throat still hurts from all those speeches.”
 Hima: “And my fan club is exhausted.”
Proposal 2: Arm Wrestling
 Masao: “How about an arm-wrestling match?”
 Shin: grinning “Not a bad idea.”
 Hima: cracking her knuckles “You sure, Onii-chan?”
 Kazama: sweating “Wait, wait, wait—”
 Ai: whispering “Hima’s way too strong. She’ll break his wrist.”
 Masao: pale “We should probably move on.”
Proposal 3: Kendo Match
 Bo: “You guys can fight it out in a kendo match.”
 Shin: “No way. If I win, Mom will kill me. If she wins, I’ll never hear the end of it.”
 Hima: “Exactly.”
Proposal 4: Co-Presidents
 Nene: “Why don’t they just share the title?”
 Hima: “No. That sounds fake.”
 Shin: “Yeah. Imagine hearing ‘President Nohara & President Nohara.’ People will think we’re some kind of corporation.”
Proposal 5: Rock-Paper-Scissors
 Yasuo: “How about we settle it with a game of rock-paper-scissors?”
 Shin & Hima: “Are you kidding me?”

Absolute Gridlock
After 30 minutes, they were still arguing.
The students had divided into factions—Team Shin, Team Hima, and Team “Who Cares, Just End This.”
The teachers looked exhausted, and Principal Ageo was rubbing his temples.
Finally, the principal sighed. “Alright, enough. We’ll make an official decision tomorrow.”
“WHAT?!” the entire school groaned.
Shin sighed. “Great. One more night of dealing with this headache.”
Hima smirked. “Better get some rest, Onii-chan. I’m taking that presidency.”
Shin grinned. “Try me.”
And just like that, the chaos was postponed… for now.
You said:
tha eveing before leaving shin dropped a suspicious vote into the ballot to make hima win, which was caught by her.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 166 – The Suspicious Vote
The election was over, or so everyone thought.
That evening, before leaving school, Shin had one last thing to do.
The gymnasium was empty now, the chaos from earlier had faded, and the only ones left behind were the teachers, some student council members, and—unnoticed by everyone—Shinnosuke Nohara.
With a glance around, he walked over to the ballot box, casually slipping his hand into his pocket. One last vote.
For Hima.
He had spent the whole election giving his all, but in the end, she wanted it more. And if he was being honest? He had already had his fun last year.
So, one little "mistake" in the counting wouldn’t hurt.
Or so he thought.
Because just as his fingers brushed against the paper slot, a voice rang out behind him.
"Onii-chan."
Shin froze.
He turned his head slowly. Himawari was standing at the doorway, arms crossed, staring right at him.

The Standoff
She took slow steps forward, her sharp eyes locked onto him like a predator catching its prey.
Shin sighed, retracting his hand. “Man, you sure know how to ruin a cool moment.”
Hima narrowed her eyes. "What do you think you're doing?"
Shin grinned, trying to play it off. “Nothing, nothing. Just admiring this fine ballot box craftsmanship.”
She raised an eyebrow. “With your hand halfway inside it?”
“…Yes.”
Hima did not look convinced.
She stepped closer, her gaze serious. "You were going to cheat to make me win, weren’t you?"
Shin chuckled, scratching his head. "Cheat? Such a strong word. I prefer ‘rearrange the odds in your favor.’"
Hima stared at him, her lips pressing into a line.
"...You idiot," she muttered.
Shin shrugged. “What can I say? You deserve it.”
Hima sighed deeply, rubbing her temples. This was so like him.

The Talk
A moment of silence passed between them.
Finally, Hima spoke. “Why?”
Shin leaned against the ballot box. “You really want this, don’t you?”
She nodded. “Of course I do.”
“Then what’s the problem?” Shin smirked. “I’m just making sure you get it.”
Hima shook her head. “That’s not how I want to win.”
Shin’s grin faltered slightly.
She looked up at him, determination in her eyes. “I don’t need your help. I want to win because I deserve it, not because you let me.”
Shin studied her for a second, then let out a small laugh. “Man, you really are something else, huh?”
She raised an eyebrow. “I learned from the best.”
Shin smirked. “…Fine. No cheating. But if I win fair and square, don’t cry about it.”
Hima crossed her arms. “If you win, I’ll accept it. But you won’t.”
Shin’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Confident, huh?”
Hima grinned. “It runs in the family.”
They both stood there for a moment, the air filled with unspoken respect.
Then, Shin stretched and turned to leave. "Alright, alright, I'll behave. See you at home, Madam President."
Hima smirked. “Not yet.”
But deep down, she knew.
Tomorrow, she was going to win. And this time, it would be her own victory.
You said:
the next day the 2 came in and shared their brilliant idea of sharing the presidency(an idea shared by kazama yesterday, which was promply discarded even before considering by the siblings)
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 167 – The Shared Presidency Proposal
The next morning, anticipation buzzed through the school halls. Everyone was eager to hear the final verdict of the intense student council election.
But the real show? That was happening inside the student council office.

The Office Meeting
Shin and Hima walked in together, side by side. A rare sight considering how the past week had been nothing but an all-out war between the two Nohara siblings.
Their friends—Ai, Kazama, Masao, Nene, Bo, Rika, Hayashi, and Yasuo—were already waiting inside.
Kazama, who had clearly suffered enough from their nonsense, adjusted his tie. "So, have you two come to a decision?"
The room fell silent as the siblings exchanged glances.
Then, at the exact same time, they smirked and spoke.
"We’ll both be president."
Silence.
Kazama twitched.
He blinked, processing what they had just said. Then, slowly, he stood up, leaned over the table, and slammed his hands down.
"I SAID THAT YESTERDAY!"
Shin tilted his head. “Did you?”
Hima smiled innocently. “I don’t remember.”
Kazama looked like he was going to explode. “I—You—!!”
He turned to the rest of the group. “THEY REJECTED IT IMMEDIATELY YESTERDAY! Without even considering it!!”
Ai, sipping on tea, nodded. “Yeah, I remember that.”
Masao scratched his head. "They shot it down before Kazama even finished his sentence."
Bo nodded. "Unfortunate."
Rika blinked, confused. "Wait, so now you’re agreeing to it?"
Shin and Hima exchanged knowing smirks before looking back at everyone.
"Yep."
Kazama lost it.
"YOU TWO ARE IMPOSSIBLE!!"

The Aftermath
After Kazama finished screaming into his hands, the others sighed in defeat.
Masao shrugged. "I mean… it kinda makes sense."
Nene sighed. "We should’ve expected this from the Noharas."
Bo, as always, remained unbothered. "At least we don’t have to pick sides anymore."
Kazama, still fuming, collapsed into his seat. "You two are the worst."
Shin patted his shoulder. “I know.”
Hima grinned. "You’ll get used to it."
As the group continued bickering about how ridiculous this was, the announcement came over the school speakers.
"Congratulations to our new student council presidents—Shinnosuke and Himawari Nohara!"
The entire school erupted into chaos.

Chapter 168 – The Reign of the Nohara Siblings Begins
The next morning, the student council office doors burst open.
Standing at the entrance, bathed in imaginary golden light, were Shinnosuke and Himawari Nohara.
The first-ever sibling duo presidents.
They walked in like royalty, chins high, shoulders back, radiating an aura of pure self-importance.
And it was painfully obvious why.

The Aftermath of Their Victory Night
The previous night at the Nohara household had been nothing short of a celebration.
Hiroshi had cried actual tears of joy. "Both my kids… ruling the school… I can retire happy!"
Misae had been so proud that she let Shin eat double the usual amount of meat at dinner. Hima got extra dessert.
The siblings had been pampered endlessly.
And now, they were feeling unstoppable.

Back in the Office
Kazama took one look at their smug faces and immediately knew.
“…You were spoiled last night, weren’t you?”
Shin smirked. "We prefer the term ‘appreciated.’"
Hima smiled sweetly. “Our parents recognized our greatness.”
Kazama rubbed his temples.
Ai, sipping on tea, hummed. “I see. So now we have two egos to handle instead of one.”
Masao sighed. “We’re doomed.”
Nene crossed her arms. "They already acted like they owned the school. Now they actually do."
Bo nodded. "Unfortunate."
The Nohara siblings, however, paid no mind to their suffering.
Instead, Shin clapped his hands together. "Alright! Time for our first official act as co-presidents!"
Hima grinned. "Yes! Let’s decide on a new rule to make the school more fun!"
The group immediately panicked.
Kazama slammed his hands on the table. “ABSOLUTELY NOT.”
Shin smirked. "Too late. The era of the Noharas has begun."
And just like that, chaos returned to the student council.
You said:
but the school started to run much better, wayyy better after the 2 joint forces.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 169 – The Golden Age of the Student Council
Despite all the initial chaos, despite the group’s fears, despite the egos—
Something unexpected happened.
The school started to run better than ever.
Like, way better.

The Ultimate Duo
With Shin’s natural charisma, insane people skills, and his ability to make anything fun, paired with Hima’s strategic thinking, ruthless efficiency, and iron will—
They somehow complimented each other perfectly.
Shin handled public relations like a king. Students loved him. Teachers, surprisingly, found him somewhat bearable now.


Hima took care of operations. She made sure everything ran smoothly behind the scenes.


Shin came up with crazy, unique ideas. Hima refined them into actual, doable plans.


Hima set strict rules. Shin made them sound cool and fun so people actually followed them.


And so, for the first time in school history…
The student council was actually respected.

The Council’s Reaction
Kazama sat in the office, reading over reports.
“…Everything is running smoothly. Attendance is up. Events are better. The budget is actually being used properly.”
Ai sipped her tea. “It’s almost terrifying.”
Masao, in awe, muttered, “They’re actually good at this.”
Nene rubbed her temples. “…I hate that they’re good at this.”
Bo nodded. "Unfortunate."
The group watched as Shin and Hima casually coordinated the upcoming festival, managing students, teachers, and logistics like seasoned pros.
Shin stretched. “Well, that was easy.”
Hima grinned. “Onto the next task, dear co-president.”
Kazama dropped his pen.
“…The world is ending.”

Chapter 170 – The Unspoken Weight
A few days had passed since the Golden Era of the student council had begun.
And yet…
Something unsettling lingered in the air.

A Conversation Overheard
It was supposed to be a normal day.
But as Nene walked past the empty hallway, she heard a familiar voice.
“…I understand… Yes, but… Do I have to?”
Ai’s voice.
Nene peeked around the corner.
Ai was leaning against the window, phone pressed to her ear.
“…It’s just—things are different now. I don’t want to…”
Silence.
Ai sighed. “…I’ll think about it.”
Then she hung up.
For the first time in a long while, Ai looked small.
Like something was crushing her.
Nene stood frozen. She had never seen Ai like that before.

The Group’s Decision
Nene immediately ran to tell the others.
In the student council office, the group sat in silence as they processed the information.
“…Moving away again?” Kazama asked, arms crossed.
Masao looked around. “…Do you think she’ll tell us?”
“She will,” Bo said simply.
Kazama nodded. “Then we shouldn’t push her.”
“…Yeah.”
A mutual agreement was made—they wouldn’t ask Ai about it.
She would tell them when she was ready.
…But someone else wasn’t as calm about it.

The Unshakable Feeling
Shin sat at his desk that night, staring at the ceiling.
He didn’t know why, but something inside him twisted at the thought of Ai leaving again.
It was weird.
It wasn’t like he hadn’t gone through this before.
He was used to people coming and going.
But this time…
It bothered him.
Like an annoying itch he couldn’t scratch.
Like a bad dream he couldn’t wake up from.
“…Tch.”
Shin turned over in bed, pulling the blanket over his head.
He had no idea what this feeling was.
But he really, really didn’t like it.
You said:
he desided to not think about it but unconsiously his attention went towards ai, and as the time passed he realised the feeling of ai not being there. make it long.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 171 – The Unseen Absence
Shin decided not to think about it.
It wasn’t like Ai had confirmed anything yet.
No need to overreact.
No need to worry.
He would just go about his daily life as usual.
...Or so he thought.

The Smallest Things
At first, it was subtle.
He’d be in the student council room, flipping through some papers, when suddenly, his eyes would drift toward Ai.
She’d be sitting across the table, scrolling through something on her phone or arguing with Nene about event planning.
Nothing unusual.
Nothing different.
Yet, his attention kept catching on her.
The way she twirled her hair when thinking.
The way she pouted when Kazama shot down one of her ridiculous ideas.
The way she smiled when something genuinely amused her.
He wasn’t staring.
He was just… noticing things more.
That’s all.
Right?

Noticing the Absence
Then came the moments where she wasn’t there.
One afternoon, she had a family errand and couldn’t join them for lunch.
Shin didn’t think much of it.
Until he sat at their usual table.
Her seat was empty.
Which wasn’t a big deal.
…But it felt off.
Her usual teasing was gone.
Her occasional stealing of his food was missing.
Lunch felt quieter.
It was the same when she wasn’t in the council office later that day.
Kazama and Nene were discussing event schedules, Bo was snacking on something, Masao was doing his best to be productive—
But the flow of everything felt different.
Like a piece of the puzzle was missing.
Shin kept telling himself it was fine.
But every time his eyes glanced toward where Ai should be, he felt that same, annoying itch in his chest.

More Than Just a Friend?
One evening, while walking home, he found himself thinking about her.
Not intentionally.
But somehow, his mind kept drifting back to the idea of Ai… not being there.
Not sitting across from him in the student council office.
Not walking beside him after school.
Not arguing with Nene.
Not trying to fluster him with some dumb romantic scheme.
It felt wrong.
That’s when the realization hit him.
He didn’t just enjoy Ai’s presence.
He had grown used to it.
It was like the air around him.
Always there, always constant.
And the thought of it suddenly disappearing…
That was what bothered him.

Denial & Distraction
Shin shook his head. No.
He was overthinking it.
Ai would probably stay.
She’d tell them when she was ready.
And even if she did leave—so what?
He had other friends.
He had his life.
He would be fine.
…Right?
Shin let out a breath and shoved his hands into his pockets.
“Whatever.”
No point in worrying about things that hadn’t even happened yet.
Yet, despite his forced indifference, his mind still clung to one lingering thought.
Would things really be the same… without her?
You said:
but this is the shin chan we are talking about so after a loong time of thinking he one eveing called ai chan to the school roof top and then on top of the water tank on it. to talk. they sat down, they talked a bit, as things were going on in a scilence enjoying it, shin suddenly said in the most shinchan way ever that he loved ai chan....
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 172 – The Most Shinchan Confession
It had been days of thinking.
Way too many days.
For someone like Shin Nohara, who usually didn’t think much before doing anything, this was torture.
So, instead of spiraling in his own thoughts, he did what made the most sense.
He called Ai-chan.
Told her to meet him.
On the school rooftop.
And then, because just the rooftop wasn’t enough, he took her on top of the water tank.
Because why not?

A Quiet Evening
The school was quiet in the evening.
The sky was painted in shades of deep orange and purple, the sun lazily dipping past the horizon.
Ai climbed up after him, dusting off her skirt before sitting next to him.
She gave him a look.
“You really couldn’t just talk to me on the normal rooftop?”
“Nah,” Shin replied casually, stretching his arms behind his head. “Too many people walk in there.”
“…We’re literally on school property after closing hours.”
“Exactly. We won’t get interrupted.”
Ai rolled her eyes, but she smiled as she turned away, watching the view in front of them.
For a moment, neither of them spoke.
They just sat there, the summer breeze brushing against them, the distant sound of cicadas filling the air.

The Moment of Truth
Shin had thought long and hard about this.
How to say it.
How to word it properly.
How to make it sound sincere but also casual enough so it wasn’t too awkward.
And in true Shinchan fashion…
All that planning went out the window.
Because after a few moments of silence, he suddenly turned to Ai and said—
"Oi, Ai-chan. I love you."
Just like that.
No buildup.
No dramatic moment.
No hesitation.
Just out of nowhere.
Ai froze.
Like… completely stopped functioning.
Her brain blue-screened.
Her mouth opened—then closed.
Then opened again—then closed.
She blinked.
Once. Twice.
And then, finally, in a completely stunned voice—
“…H-Huh?”
Shin, looking completely unbothered, simply repeated, “I love you.”
Casual. Direct. As if he just told her the weather was nice today.
Ai stared at him.
Processing.
Her heart was slamming against her ribcage.
Her face felt hotter than the sun.
Shin Nohara.
The boy she had chased after for years.
The boy who had never reacted to any of her flirty attempts.
The boy who she thought might never actually realize his feelings.
Just casually dropped a love confession on her in the most Shinchan way possible.
“…Are you messing with me?” she finally managed to say.
“Nah,” Shin replied, his gaze still on the sky. “I mean it.”
Ai felt her soul leave her body.

Reality Hits
For a solid minute, Ai didn’t know what to do.
Her brain was yelling at her to say something.
To react. To scream. To do anything.
But all she could do was sit there, her hands clenching the fabric of her skirt, her face turning a deeper shade of red.
Then, suddenly—
Shin let out a long sigh, stretching again.
“Man, that felt good to say. I was thinking about it too much.”
Ai slowly turned to him.
“Too much…?” she echoed.
“Yeah,” he said, grinning. “Kept thinking, ‘What’s the big deal? I like her, so I’ll just say it.’”
Ai buried her face in her hands.
This was so like him.
So frustratingly, stupidly, naturally Shin.
Her heart felt like it was about to explode.
She took a deep breath, trying to regain some composure.
And then, finally—
She lifted her head, looked at him, and with a trembling smile, said—
“…I love you too, you idiot.”
Shin just grinned, looking at her for a second before turning back to the sky.
“Cool.”
Ai stared at him.
“‘Cool’? That’s all you have to say??”
“Yeah. What, you wanted me to make a whole speech?”
“…You’re impossible.”

The Aftermath
For the rest of the evening, they sat there.
Not saying much.
Just enjoying the moment.
The sky turned darker, the stars beginning to peek out.
Ai felt light-headed, like she was floating.
She had imagined this moment a thousand times.
None of her fantasies came close to the real thing.
It was stupid.
It was casual.
It was so incredibly Shinchan.
And she wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
You said:
he helped her down, they went home. but after all this she forgot to ask if they were dating, as its shinchan we are talking about here.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 173 – Wait… Are We Even Dating?
After sitting on top of the water tank for who knows how long, Shin finally stretched, cracked his neck, and said—
“Alright, let’s go home.”
Ai blinked, still dazed.
“…Huh?”
Shin was already climbing down.
Ai scrambled to follow him, her mind still replaying his words over and over again.
“I love you.”
He actually said it.
It happened.
And she had said it back.
She could barely feel the ground under her feet as they walked down the empty school halls and out through the gates.
A cool breeze hit her, making her shiver—not from the cold, but from the sheer adrenaline of what just happened.
The streets were quiet as they walked side by side.
Not too close.
Not too far.
Just casual.
Just like always.
It felt so normal that Ai almost wondered if that moment on the rooftop had even happened.
But then she looked at Shin.
He seemed… content.
Not flustered.
Not embarrassed.
Just… normal.
Like he hadn’t just dropped the biggest confession of her life.
Like this was just another regular evening.
Ai clenched her fists.
She had so many things she wanted to ask.
So many questions swirling in her head.
But instead, she just followed him home.
And before she knew it—
They were at her front gate.
“Alright, see ya.” Shin waved lazily. “Sleep early or whatever.”
Ai barely muttered a “Yeah” before walking inside, her heart still hammering.
It wasn’t until she flopped onto her bed that the biggest realization hit her.

Wait. Are We Even Dating??
Her eyes snapped open.
She sat up.
Her brain finally functioned properly again.
He told her he loved her.
She told him she loved him back.
…But that was it.
He never actually asked her out.
He never said anything about dating.
And, worst of all—
She forgot to ask.
Ai screamed into her pillow.
“WHY AM I IN LOVE WITH SUCH AN IDIOT?!”
This.
Was so.
Unbelievably.
Shinchan.
You said:
so now what will happen at school.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 174 – Are They…? No, They Can’t Be… Right?
Morning – The Student Council Room
Kazama rubbed his temples as he watched Shin lean back on his chair, his feet propped up on the desk like he had no responsibilities in life.
Across from him, Ai sat a little too stiffly, a slight pink tinge on her face as she stole glances at Shin.
Something felt… off.
Bo, as usual, sat quietly, sipping his tea. Nene, on the other hand, was eyeing Ai like a hawk.
Kazama finally spoke.
“…Did something happen between you two?”
Ai flinched.
Shin barely tilted his head.
“What do you mean?”
“You guys are acting weird.” Kazama crossed his arms. “Ai keeps looking at you like she’s expecting something, and you… Well, you’re still a dumbass, but there’s something… different.”
At that moment, Masao barged in.
“YOU GUYS WON’T BELIEVE WHAT I JUST HEARD!”
Everyone turned to him.
Masao huffed, catching his breath. “Rumors are going around that you two are dating!”
Ai froze.
Shin… blinked.
Kazama, Nene, and Bo all turned to Ai expectantly.
Ai slowly turned her head to Shin.
This was it.
This was where he was supposed to say something.
To confirm or deny it.
But Shin just… shrugged.
“…Huh. That’s neat.”
Ai almost flipped the entire table.

Hallways – Chaos Ensues
“Wait, wait, wait—so Nohara and Ai-chan are ACTUALLY TOGETHER?!”
“I heard he confessed on the school rooftop.”
“WHAT?! When did that happen?!”
“I dunno, but that means he’s actually serious about her, right?!”
“Wait, but did they actually start dating, or was it just a confession?!”
“Who even knows, it’s SHINCHAN.”
“I asked Ai-chan directly, but she just blushed and ran away!”
The school was buzzing.

Lunchtime – The Confrontation
Ai poked her food aggressively.
Shin casually slurped his ramen like nothing was happening.
Finally, Nene slammed her hands on the table.
“Alright, ENOUGH! Are you guys dating or NOT?!”
The entire table went silent.
Ai nearly choked on air.
Shin… blinked.
He tilted his head slightly.
“…I mean, I love her, and she loves me. That counts, right?”
The entire table screamed.
“THAT’S NOT HOW IT WORKS!”
Ai buried her face in her hands.
Why.
Why was he like this?!
Why did she love such a moron?!
She took a deep breath.
“Shin.”
“Yeah?”
“…Are we dating?”
Shin… actually paused.
“…I guess not?”
Ai almost flipped the table again.
Shin tapped his chin, thinking. “Oh. Should we?”
The group stared at him like he was the dumbest person alive.
Ai, however, took a deep breath.
She looked him dead in the eye.
And then—
“…Yes. We should.”
Shin blinked.
Then—
“…Okay.”
Nene slammed her head on the table.
Kazama looked like he was about to cry.
Masao was hyperventilating.
Bo calmly sipped his tea.
And just like that—
Shin and Ai officially started dating.
You said:
they dated but things werent too differnt.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 175 – Dating? Sure. But Nothing Changes.
Despite all the drama, chaos, and screaming that happened when Shin and Ai officially started dating, the next day at school…
Nothing really changed.
Ai still sat next to Shin in the student council office, occasionally sneaking glances at him.
Shin still acted as carefree as ever, munching on snacks Kazama told him not to eat in the office.
Kazama still nagged at him.
Nene still gossiped and interrogated Ai.
Masao still stressed over things.
Bo still drank his tea.
The world kept turning.

Lunchtime – The Expectations vs. Reality
Nene slammed her hands on the table.
“WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOTHING HAS CHANGED?!”
Ai sighed, poking her food.
“I mean… we’re dating now, but…” She glanced at Shin, who was casually stealing food off of Bo’s plate. “He’s still just… Shin.”
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose.
“You mean to tell me—after ALL that—he still doesn’t treat you differently?!”
Ai blinked.
“…Should he?”
Nene almost flipped the table.
Masao leaned in.
“Wait, wait, wait—have you guys even gone on a date yet?”
Ai slowly turned to Shin.
Shin… froze mid-bite.
“…Oh.” He blinked. “Are we supposed to?”
Kazama slammed his head on the table.
Bo sipped his tea.
Ai sighed again.
“Guess I should be the one to ask him out first, huh?”
Shin shrugged.
“Sure. Wanna go out this weekend?”
The table went silent.
Masao gasped.
Kazama looked up in shock.
Nene’s jaw dropped.
Bo blinked.
Ai… turned red.
“W-What?!”
Shin tilted his head.
“You wanted me to ask, right?” He casually sipped his drink. “So? You in?”
Ai was malfunctioning.
Kazama grabbed Bo’s arm.
“…Is this really happening?”
Bo nodded.
“…It appears so.”
Nene clapped her hands together.
“Alright. The first official Shin x Ai Date is happening this weekend. We need to prepare.”
Masao gulped.
“…Prepare how?”
Nene’s eyes glowed.
“We’re going to spy on them, obviously.”
Shin glanced at Ai.
“…You think we should mess with them a little?”
Ai smirked.
“…Oh, definitely.”
You said:
but before anything this bomb shell was dropped casually by shin at his home.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 176 – The Bombshell at Home
It was a quiet evening at the Nohara residence. Misae was setting the table, Hiroshi was scrolling through his phone, and Hima was flipping through a magazine. Dinner was almost ready.
Then, in the most casual, Shin-chan way possible…
“By the way, Ai-chan and I are dating now.”
Silence.
The room froze.
Misae slowly turned, a ladle of curry dripping onto the floor.
Hiroshi blinked.
Hima choked on her juice.
“…What?” Misae finally managed.
Shin grabbed a bowl of rice, completely unfazed.
“I said, Ai-chan and I are dating now.” He stuffed a spoonful into his mouth. “Pass the pickles?”
Misae dropped the ladle.
“EXCUSE ME?!”
Hiroshi put his phone down.
Hima wiped her mouth.
“…Since when?” Hiroshi asked, cautiously.
Shin shrugged. “A few days ago?”
Misae squinted.
“And you’re just telling us NOW?”
Shin continued eating.
“…Didn’t think it was a big deal.”
A big deal.
Misae clenched her fists.
“YOU—”
Hiroshi quickly held her back.
“Wait, wait, honey, let’s not kill him yet—”
Hima pouted.
“So does that mean Ai-nee is my sister now?”
Shin pointed at her.
“Technically, yes.”
Hima smirked.
“I approve.”
Misae groaned. “I don’t know if I do.”
Shin looked up.
“Why? You’ve been saying for years I should date someone like Ai-chan.”
Misae froze.
“…T-That’s—”
Hiroshi smirked.
“She did say that.”
Misae shot him a glare.
Hima leaned on her elbows.
“So… when’s the wedding?”
Misae choked.
“Hima!”
Shin grinned. “Give it some time.”
Misae collapsed onto the table.
“…My son is an idiot.”
Hiroshi patted her back.
“But he’s a lovable idiot.”
Misae sighed.
“Fine. But if you break Ai-chan’s heart—”
Shin held up his hands.
“Relax, relax. I like her.” He grinned. “She’s cute when she’s flustered.”
Hima giggled.
“Ohhh, you’re so doomed, Onii-chan.”
Misae shook her head.
“…I need tea.”
Shin finished his rice.
“So… pickles?”
You said:
the date. the date?
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 177 – The Date? The Date!
The moment had finally arrived.
Shin and Ai’s first official date.
…Or at least, that’s what Ai thought.
Shin? Well, he was just going with the flow.

Ai checked her reflection for the tenth time.
“Alright… looking good.”
Her outfit was perfect. Cute, but not trying too hard. Stylish, but comfortable. It screamed, ‘This is totally casual and not a date but also very much a date.’
She checked the time.
Fifteen minutes left…
Her heart raced.
“Calm down, Ai… It’s just Shin-chan.”
Then she remembered who she was talking about.
“…Never mind. Panic is valid.”

Meanwhile, Shin was chilling at home.
“Okaa-san, where’s my good shorts?”
Misae turned, eyeing him suspiciously.
“You’re going out?”
Shin nodded.
“Yup. Ai-chan and I are meeting up.”
Misae froze.
“…Meeting up?”
Shin tilted his head.
“Yeah.”
Misae crossed her arms.
“A date?”
Shin shrugged.
“I guess?”
Misae clutched her heart.
“…I don’t know whether to be happy or horrified.”
Hima popped up behind them.
“Ohhh, Onii-chan is finally going on a real date?”
Shin grinned.
“Wanna come?”
Misae threw a sandal.
“NO, SHE’S NOT COMING!”

The Meeting Point
Ai stood at the station, checking the time again.
Five minutes left…
Then—
“Yo, Ai-chan.”
She turned—
And there he was.
Shin.
…Wearing his usual casual clothes. No effort, no nerves, just Shin.
Ai felt a twitch in her eyebrow.
Seriously?
“Did you even try dressing up?” she asked.
Shin looked down at his outfit.
“…I showered?”
Ai sighed.
It’s fine. It’s fine. It’s fine.
She smiled. “Let’s go, then.”
Shin shoved his hands in his pockets. “Lead the way.”

The Date…?
First stop?
The mall.
Ai had planned it all. They’d walk around, maybe shop a little, get something sweet, and then head to a cute café she found.
What actually happened?
Shin got distracted.
“Oh! A game arcade?”
Ai grabbed his wrist. “No. We are NOT—”
Five minutes later.
Shin was playing air hockey like his life depended on it.
Ai sighed.
…Why am I not surprised?
Still… watching him so into it was kinda—
“Ai-chan, hurry up! Play against me!”
Ai rolled her eyes but smiled.
“Fine. But if I win, you owe me cake.”
Shin smirked.
“You’re on.”

Two Hours Later
They had somehow:
 ✅ Played five rounds of air hockey.
 ✅ Spent 30 minutes in a claw machine war.
 ✅ Got banned from karaoke for being “too loud” (Shin’s fault).
 ✅ Wandered into a bookstore (Ai’s choice).
 ✅ Forgot to actually go to the cute café.
Now, they were sitting on a bench, eating ice cream.
Ai took a bite of her cone and sighed.
“This… wasn’t what I planned.”
Shin licked his ice cream.
“…Huh? You planned something?”
Ai stared at him.
“Wait. You thought this was just a casual hangout?”
Shin blinked.
“…Isn’t it?”
Silence.
Ai’s eye twitched.
He… He really is an idiot.
She sighed. Deep breaths.
“…Forget it. I had fun anyway.”
Shin grinned.
“See? That’s what matters.”
Ai rolled her eyes but smiled.
Maybe this wasn’t a traditional date.
…But it was very Shin-chan.
And honestly?
She wouldn’t have it any other way.
You said:
she realised a week after they started dating but shin had became more "casual" about things after the confession, before he used to give reaction but now it nothing.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 178 – Wait… Are We Even Dating?!
Ai had one simple realization.
One week into dating Shin, she noticed something deeply disturbing.
He had stopped reacting.
Before, when she flirted with him, he would at least roll his eyes, tease her back, or even blush a little. But now?
Nothing.
It was like dating him gave him an immunity boost.

At Lunch – The Crisis Begins
Ai slammed her hands on the table.
"Something is wrong!"
Kazama, Masao, Nene, and Bo stared.
"...What?" Nene asked, raising an eyebrow.
Ai leaned in.
"It's Shin. He's acting too… too normal."
Kazama adjusted his glasses (mentally, since he doesn’t wear them).
"Define 'normal'?"
Ai frowned.
"Before, he at least reacted when I flirted. But now? Nothing! It's like my flirting is just background noise to him!"
Bo nodded.
"...Maybe he's just comfortable now."
Masao gulped. "Or maybe… he’s bored of you?"
Silence.
Nene smacked Masao.
"WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?!"
Ai froze.
“…No way.”
That can’t be it… right?!

Testing the Theory
Ai decided to run experiments.
Test #1: The Classic Whisper
In the middle of the student council room, Ai leaned in close to Shin’s ear.
“Shin-chan… you smell really good today~”
Shin, without even looking up from his work, responded:
“Yeah, I showered.”
Test result: FAILURE.

Test #2: The Accidental Touch
She brushed her fingers over his hand while handing him a document.
Shin?
No reaction. He just took the paper and kept working.
Test result: FAILURE.

Test #3: The Direct Attack
At the vending machine, Ai suddenly grabbed his tie, pulling him close.
“Shin-chan~” she whispered.
Shin took a sip of his drink.
“…You okay?”
Ai’s eye twitched.
TEST. RESULT. FAILURE.

Ai Was Losing It
"What is going on?!" Ai ranted to Nene after school.
"He used to react! But now he’s untouchable. It’s like I unlocked some kind of ‘Shin-chan Ultra Instinct’ mode!"
Nene tapped her chin.
"Maybe he’s trying to play it cool?"
Ai shook her head.
“No. If it was that, he’d at least smirk or something. This is different.”
Nene squinted.
“…Wait. You did confess first, right?”
Ai’s soul left her body.
“…No.”
Nene’s jaw dropped.
“WAIT—THEN HOW DID THIS EVEN HAPPEN?!”
Ai held her head.
“…I don’t know. One second we were talking, the next, he just dropped ‘I love you’ on me like it was a casual weather update.”
Nene grabbed Ai’s shoulders.
“…Ai. I hate to say this, but I think you need to have a real conversation about this.”
Ai groaned.
“But that’s so embarrassing…”
Nene sighed.
“Would you rather suffer?”
“…No.”
“Then go talk to your idiot boyfriend.”
Ai took a deep breath.
“…Fine.”

The Confrontation
That evening, Ai texted Shin.
Ai: Meet me on the rooftop.
 Shin: Why?
 Ai: Just come!

Shin arrived first.
Ai stared at him.
“…Shin-chan. Be honest with me.”
Shin blinked.
“…Did I do something?”
“No, but why are you so chill now?!”
Shin tilted his head.
“Huh?”
Ai groaned.
“You used to react when I flirted with you. Now? Nothing! Why?”
Shin thought for a moment.
“…Oh.”
Ai waited.
Shin scratched his cheek.
“…Well, I guess before, I didn’t really know what I felt. So when you teased me, I had to think about it. But now?”
He grinned.
“I already like you, so I don’t need to think anymore.”
Ai froze.
“…Wait,
You said:
he says, before he had to think about her differently with mixed feelings, so he got flustered by her doing such things, but now that they were dating he can do such things with her when ever, and there is not reason to be flustered as they L-O-V-E each other.
ChatGPT said:
Shin's Unexpected Logic
Shin grinned.
“I already like you, so I don’t need to think anymore.”
Ai froze.
“…Wait, what?”
Shin rubbed the back of his head.
“Well, before, when you flirted, I had to think about you differently. I wasn’t sure what I felt, so I got flustered.”
Ai blinked.
“…And now?”
Shin shrugged.
“Now that we’re dating, I can do those things whenever. I don’t have to overthink. So why would I get flustered?”
He gave her a lazy grin.
“We L-O-V-E each other, don’t we?”
Ai stared.
Her brain short-circuited.

Ai's Brain in Panic Mode
What is this?!
Why does this logic make sense?! But also—WHY DOES IT SOUND SO UNFAIR?!
Ai grabbed Shin’s collar.
“THAT DOESN’T MEAN YOU CAN JUST BE IMMUNE!”
Shin chuckled.
“But I can.”
“…WHAT?!”
Shin poked her cheek.
“I mean, why should I freak out when it’s just us? You’re mine, and I’m yours.”
He smirked.
“So, technically, you should be more flustered than me now.”
Ai’s soul ascended.
Her face turned red.
“…You… you can’t just say stuff like that.”
Shin grinned wider.
“But I can.”

Ai's Realization
Ai clenched her fists.
Shin had completely flipped the game.
Before, she had the upper hand. She teased him, flirted, and made him flustered.
But now?
He had become untouchable.
No—worse. He had turned it against her.

Shin's Finishing Move
Shin stood up and stretched.
“Well, if that’s all, I’ll walk you home.”
Ai, still fuming, stomped behind him.
She needed a new plan.
Shin-chan… you may have won this round.
But Ai-chan NEVER loses.
You said:
but as an apology he held her hand as they 2 went home together the entire way.
ChatGPT said:
A Rare Gesture
Just as Ai was still fuming and plotting her counterattack, Shin suddenly reached out—
And held her hand.
Ai froze.
Shin didn’t even look at her.
He just casually walked beside her, their fingers interlocked, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
Ai’s heart skipped a beat.

Ai.exe Has Stopped Working
H-He’s holding my hand…
Shin-chan… is holding my hand…?
She snuck a glance at him.
No teasing grin. No smirk.
Just calm.
Her heart did a backflip.
This wasn’t just some joke.
This was real.

Shin's Casual Confession
After a while, Shin finally spoke.
“I guess I should apologize for breaking your game.”
Ai raised an eyebrow, still a little dazed.
“…So you do feel bad?”
Shin shrugged.
“Not really.”
“…Oi.”
He grinned.
“But I figured this would make you feel better.”
He lifted their joined hands slightly.
Ai felt her face heat up.
“…You’re such a pain.”
Shin just chuckled.
“Yup. But I’m your pain now.”

A Quiet Walk Home
They walked the rest of the way hand-in-hand.
No teasing. No banter.
Just a quiet moment between the two of them.
Ai squeezed his hand.
Shin squeezed back.
And for the first time since they started dating, Ai didn’t feel the need to win.
She just felt…

Chapter 180: A Father's Return
As they approached Ai’s massive mansion, the usual quiet of the neighborhood was interrupted by the low purr of an expensive car engine.
Shin stopped mid-step.
A sleek black limousine was parked at the front gate, the kind Shin had only ever seen in movies or dramas. The driver quickly stepped out and opened the door with crisp precision.
And then—
A tall man stepped out.

The Mystery Man
The man had slicked-back hair, sharp features, and a perfectly tailored suit that screamed “Money.”
But more than that—
He had an aura.
The kind that made people subconsciously straighten their backs.
The kind that silenced entire rooms.
Shin wasn’t intimidated—but he definitely noticed.
And then—
Ai’s voice rang out.

“Is That You, Dad!?”
The man turned—
And his serious expression instantly melted.
“AI!!”
His deep voice boomed with warmth, and before Ai could even react—
He had already moved forward and pulled her into a tight hug.
Shin stood there, blinking.
“…Huh.”

A Father's Love
Ai’s father held her like she was the most precious thing in the world.
“My little girl! You’ve grown so much!” he said, ruffling her hair.
“Dad! Stop treating me like a kid!” Ai huffed, though she clearly wasn’t upset.
Her father grinned.
“I haven’t seen you in three years. Let me have this moment.”
Three years?
Shin’s eyes narrowed slightly.
That was a long time.

Like Shin and Hima
Shin watched as Ai’s father continued fussing over her—asking about school, if she was eating well, and if she was sleeping properly.
It reminded him of himself and Hima.
He had never really thought about Ai’s family situation.
But now, seeing her completely relaxed in her father’s embrace…
Shin realized just how much she must have missed him.

The Moment is Ruined (Of Course)
Then—
Her father finally seemed to notice the extra presence.
His sharp eyes snapped to Shin.
“And who is this?”
Ai froze.
Shin blinked.
Ai’s father stared.
Ai panicked.
And Shin—
With the most deadpan expression ever—
Said,
“I’m your daughter’s boyfriend.”

Ai.exe Has Stopped Working (Again)
Ai choked.
Her father froze.
The air itself seemed to go still.
And then—
“…Excuse me?”
Shin gave him a polite nod.
“I’m Nohara Shinnosuke. Ai-chan’s boyfriend.”
“…”
Ai’s father slowly turned his gaze back to Ai, who looked like she had just been electrocuted.
“Is this true?”
Ai’s mouth opened and closed like a fish.
Then, finally—
She clenched her fists, squared her shoulders, and said,
“YES.”
The father nodded slowly.
Then, without missing a beat—
“Driver, cancel all my business meetings for tomorrow. I have something important to do.”
Shin raised an eyebrow.
Ai turned pale.
And that was how Shin unknowingly secured an interview with his future father-in-law.
You said:
what antic will shinchan show, or will he be serious this time around. chapter 181,( novel like, end chapters with "continued in xyz ch")
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 181: The Interview of Doom
Shin had faced many dangerous situations in his life.
Getting chased by an angry Nene? Child’s play.
 Hima’s tantrums? Terrorizing, but manageable.
 Facing a full-contact Kendo match? Exciting.
But this?
This was true danger.

The Night Before the Storm
Shin sat on his bed, staring at the ceiling.
Hima, lying on his stomach, kicked her legs back and forth.
“So…” she started. “You’re meeting Ai-nee’s dad.”
“Yup.”
“And he’s filthy rich.”
“Yup.”
“And he cleared his schedule just to meet you.”
“…Yup.”
Hima rolled onto her back, grinning.
“You’re gonna die.”
Shin didn’t respond.
He already knew.

Meeting the Boss
The next afternoon, Shin stood in front of the mansion gates.
Ai had texted him the dress code, so he showed up in…
Well, what he considered "formal."
A decent white shirt.
 Black pants that weren’t his school uniform.
 And—
…His favorite banana-patterned socks.
(Classy.)
The security guards eyed him as they let him in.
Inside, Ai was waiting, looking tense.
“Don’t… do anything stupid,” she begged.
Shin just smiled.
“No promises.”

The Final Boss: Ai’s Father
The dining hall was ridiculously huge.
Ai’s father sat at the head of a long table.
He looked as serious as ever, his hands clasped together.
Ai sat beside him, looking like she wanted to sink into the floor.
And Shin?
Shin casually took his seat.
Then—
He leaned back, put his arms behind his head, and said,
“Sooo… what's up?”

The Test Begins
Ai slammed her head against the table.
Her father just stared.
“Shinnosuke-kun,” he said, voice calm. “Do you know why I asked to meet you?”
“Because I’m dating your daughter?” Shin said, grinning.
“Correct.”
Shin nodded.
“You must be so proud.”
Ai kicked him under the table.

Interrogation Round 1
“Shinnosuke-kun,” her father continued, ignoring the stupidity.
“What are your future plans?”
Shin tilted his head.
“Future plans?”
“Yes.”
“For work? Or for dinner?”
Ai choked.
Her father’s eyebrow twitched.
“…For your career.”
Shin shrugged.
“I was thinking of becoming a househusband.”
Ai’s father visibly froze.
Ai nearly fainted.
Shin, enjoying himself, continued.
“You see, Ai-chan is rich. And she’s smart. And she’s gonna be super successful. So I can just, y’know—”
He made a lazy ‘relaxing’ motion.
“—stay home, cook, and take care of the kids.”

Interrogation Round 2
“Do you have any serious ambitions?”
Shin finally straightened up.
He tapped his fingers against the table.
“…Kendo,” he admitted. “I used to be serious about it.”
Ai’s father nodded, interested.
“And?”
“I quit a while back. But I’m thinking of starting again.”
Ai’s father studied him.
There was something different in Shin’s expression now.
For the first time, the older man saw a glimpse of the real Shinnosuke.
Not the idiot.
 Not the troublemaker.
 But the guy who doesn’t lose when he’s serious.
“…I see.”

Final Round: The Real Question
Ai’s father leaned forward.
“Do you love my daughter?”
Silence.
Then—
Shin leaned forward too.
“Didn’t I already say it?” he said, voice quieter.
Ai froze.
Her father narrowed his eyes.
Shin looked dead serious.
“I love Ai-chan,” he said, casually but firmly.
“…And if you want to test that, go ahead.”
The room went silent.
Ai’s father studied him, and then—
A small smile appeared.
“Good.”

The Aftermath
The meeting ended shortly after.
Ai was still processing.
“I can’t believe you actually said all that…”
Shin stretched.
“What? I was just being honest.”
Ai stared.
Then, unexpectedly, she grinned.
“A househusband, huh?”
Shin chuckled.
“Yeah. You’ll be the one making money. I’ll just look pretty.”
Ai laughed.
“…You’re an idiot.”
Shin smirked.
“And you love me for it.”
Ai blushed.
And with that—
The legendary interrogation was over.
(Continued in Chapter 182.)
You said:
the next weekend the nohara family was visited by a rich, RIch lady, is it ai's mom??
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 182: The Arrival of Chaos
It was a peaceful weekend at the Nohara household.
Which meant—something was about to happen.

A Suspicious Visit
Misae was vacuuming.
 Hiroshi was reading the newspaper.
 Hima was playing with Shiro.
 Shin was lying on the floor, contemplating life.
Then—
DING DONG.
The doorbell rang.
Misae sighed. “Shin, get the door.”
Shin groaned, dragged himself up, and opened the door.
Then—he froze.
Because standing there was—
A ridiculously elegant lady.
Her clothes screamed "I own three yachts."
 Her jewelry said "I can buy your entire bloodline."
 And her presence was intimidating as hell.
She adjusted her sunglasses and looked down at him.
“You must be Shinnosuke-kun.”

The Nohara Family Reacts
A few minutes later—
Everyone was seated in the living room.
The elegant lady sipped her tea with grace.
Meanwhile—
The Noharas:
Misae sat stiffly, trying to look polite.


Hiroshi was sweating buckets.


Hima was staring, fascinated.


Shin? Shin was just eating snacks like nothing was happening.


Finally, Misae cleared her throat.
“So, um… what brings you here, Miss…?”
The lady smiled.
“Ah. I haven’t introduced myself, have I?”
She placed her teacup down elegantly.
“I am Kurogami Reina.”
“Ai’s mother.”
Silence.
Then—
Misae choked on air.
Hiroshi nearly dropped his teacup.
Hima just blinked.
And Shin—
Shin muttered under his breath.
“…I should’ve guessed.”

The True Reason for Her Visit
After Misae stopped panicking, the conversation continued.
“So… why are you here?” Hiroshi asked nervously.
Reina smiled.
“I simply wanted to see the boy my daughter is dating.”
The pressure in the room increased.
Shin continued munching on snacks.
“…And?” he said, mouth full.
Reina’s eye twitched.
(He has no fear.)
She took a deep breath.
“Well, I must admit… I was curious about you.”
Then, she smirked.
“And now that I’ve met you—”
She leaned in.
“—I have decided to test you.”

The Challenge
Misae’s eyes widened.
Hiroshi turned pale.
Even Hima looked interested.
But Shin?
Shin just raised an eyebrow.
“…Test?”
Reina smiled.
“Yes. I can’t just let my daughter date anyone.”
She clasped her hands together.
“So, starting now, I will evaluate you.”
Shin leaned back.
“Alright. Go ahead.”
Misae grabbed his arm.
“Shin! Take this seriously!”
“I am,” he said. “She wants to test me? Let her.”
Reina chuckled.
“Very well.”
She looked at him directly.
“Let’s start with something simple.”
She picked up a spoon.
“Do you know which country this silverware was imported from?”
Silence.
Shin stared at the spoon.
Then, with zero hesitation—
He said,
“…The one that makes spoons?”

The Nohara Family Loses It
Misae: FACEPALM.
 Hiroshi: Coughing violently.
 Hima: Giggling.
Reina…?
Reina closed her eyes.
She took a deep breath.
Then—she laughed.
“…You’re quite the character.”
Shin just grinned.
“I get that a lot.”

The Verdict
Reina took another sip of tea.
“Well… I suppose I’ve seen enough.”
Misae blinked. “That’s it?”
“Yes,” Reina said.
Then, she turned to Shin.
“You may be an idiot.”
Shin nodded. “True.”
“You may be uncultured.”
“Also true.”
“…But my daughter adores you.”
Shin smirked.
“Yup.”
Reina sighed.
“…I suppose that’s enough for now.”
Then, she stood up.
“However—”
She pointed at him.
“I will be watching you.”
Shin saluted.
“Yes, ma’am.”
Reina smirked.
And just like that—she left.

The Aftermath
The house was silent for a while.
Then—
Misae collapsed on the couch.
“I almost died.”
Hiroshi wiped his sweat.
“She was terrifying.”
Hima giggled. “That was fun.”
And Shin?
Shin just stretched.
“Well. That went well.”
Misae stared.
“…WELL?!”
Shin grinned.
“I mean, she didn’t kill me. That’s a win.”
Misae groaned.
And thus—
The legendary visit ended.
(Continued in Chapter 183.)

shapter 183. in school one day shin over heard the the girls from their friend grp talk, all the guys over heard it, in which he heard ai say that she loves guys who put in actual effort, and show their full potential and not hide it. and the rest talked too. (ITS IS LIKE A NOVEL NO SUB HEADINGS YOU CUNT)
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 183: The Words That Stuck
It was just another ordinary school day. The group had split up for a bit, the boys lingering around the vending machines while the girls sat together, chatting. Shin, Kazama, Masao, and the others weren’t eavesdropping, not really. It was just that the conversation happening just a few meters away was impossible to ignore.
"Honestly, I love guys who actually put in the effort," Ai’s voice rang out, clear and confident. "Not just someone who’s capable but someone who actually shows it, you know? Hiding your potential is such a waste."
Shin didn’t react at first. It was just a passing comment. But the words—they stuck.
The conversation continued, Nene laughing about how some guys tried way too hard to impress girls, while Rika mentioned how she liked when someone was ambitious. Hayashi muttered something about how he admired people who had clear goals. It was normal talk. Casual. But Shin found himself uncharacteristically quiet as he sipped on his juice box.
Kazama noticed. He always did. "Shin…?"
"Hm?"
"You okay?"
Shin turned to him, then took another sip of his drink before saying, "Yeah. Just thinking."
And that was weird.
Because when did Shin ever sit around and just think?
The rest of the boys had caught on too. Masao was looking between them nervously, and Bo simply watched in his usual calm manner. Yosuo and Hayashi, who had tagged along, shared a glance but said nothing.
The conversation on the other side continued for a while longer before the bell rang, signaling the end of the break. The boys walked ahead while the girls followed behind, still chatting.
Shin walked slightly ahead of the group, his hands behind his head, that easygoing grin still in place. But for once, his mind wasn’t wandering aimlessly.
Instead, a single thought kept circling back.
Not just someone who’s capable… but someone who actually shows it.
He had never really thought about it like that.
After all—he had always been smart. Always been capable. But he never saw the point in showing it. It was just too much effort, and honestly? He had never really cared.
But Ai did.
And that meant something.
It bothered him.
Not in a bad way. Not in an annoying way. But in a way that made him feel... something.
And for the first time in a long time, he wondered—
What if I actually tried?
(Continued in Chapter 184.)
You said:
then shin changed infront if his grp, class, school, house, infront of ai's father and ai's mother. and asfter a while ai noticed.(long chapter)
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 184: The Change in Nohara Shinnosuke
It started small.
At first, no one noticed.
Shin was still Shin. The same carefree, laid-back troublemaker who did things at his own pace. But little by little, something shifted.
The first sign came in class.
Usually, Shin had two modes during lessons—sleeping with his eyes open or making some comment that made the teacher sigh in exhaustion. But now, he was paying attention. Not just in a passive, ‘I guess I’ll listen’ way, but in a way that made even the teachers do a double-take.
During math, when the teacher called on students to answer a difficult problem, Shin answered before anyone else. And he wasn’t just throwing out random nonsense to get a laugh. His answer was correct.
The class fell silent.
Even Kazama, who was used to Shin’s unpredictability, blinked in surprise.
"Huh," Shin said, tapping his chin. "That was easier than I thought."
The teacher, who had already prepared to scold him, paused. "Uh… good job, Nohara."
The second sign came during lunch.
Instead of spending the entire time messing around, Shin took a solid ten minutes to read. Not manga. A textbook.
"Okay, who are you and what have you done with Shin?" Masao finally asked, watching him like he was an alien.
"Yeah, seriously," Nene added, raising an eyebrow. "Are you sick? Got possessed by a study ghost or something?"
Shin just grinned. "Nah. Just thought I’d use my time a bit differently."
And then he went back to reading.
The third sign came after school.
Kendo practice.
For the longest time, Shin had been doing the bare minimum, only showing his full skill when absolutely necessary. He never took things too seriously, always slacking off just enough to stay good, but not great.
But today—he dominated.
His stance was sharp, his strikes were precise, and when he moved, he was fast. Faster than anyone had seen him before.
By the end of practice, even the coach was speechless.
"What’s gotten into you, Nohara?" the captain asked, wiping the sweat from his forehead.
Shin smirked, stretching his arms. "Dunno. Just felt like it."
The fourth sign came at home.
At dinner, Misae and Hiroshi stared at Shin in shock.
"Who are you?" Misae finally asked.
Shin took another bite of his food. "Your son."
"No, you’re not," Hiroshi said immediately. "Our son is a lazy, good-for-nothing slacker who only works hard when there’s food involved. You, on the other hand—"
"—have been studying, training, and behaving like an actual, proper student," Misae finished, eyes narrowed.
Hima, sitting across from him, rested her chin on her hands. "Did my brother finally grow up?"
Shin shrugged. "I just figured it was time to put in some effort."
His family stared.
Then Misae burst into tears.
"My baby boy is finally taking life seriously!"
Hiroshi wiped an imaginary tear. "I’m so proud… but also kinda scared."
Hima smirked. "Ai-chan’s going to lose her mind."
And she did.
Because the fifth sign happened in front of Ai’s parents.
One evening, Ai had invited him over for dinner—something that had been planned weeks ago. Her mother, a regal and intimidating woman, had returned from a business trip, and her father—who adored Ai more than anything—was still home.
Shin came in, greeted them properly, and when Ai’s father made an offhand remark about his studies, Shin recited his entire class ranking and progress.
The man froze.
Ai’s mother narrowed her eyes.
Ai, sitting next to Shin, slowly turned to stare at him.
"You... what?" she whispered.
Shin just smiled. "Oh, did I not mention? I’ve been working a bit harder lately."
A bit?
Ai’s father, after a moment of silence, burst into laughter. "Now THIS is a man I like!"
Ai’s mother, ever the composed woman, simply sipped her tea, observing Shin carefully. "Impressive."
Ai, on the other hand, was still processing.
And then—it hit her.
All those times in the past few weeks when he had been just a little more focused, a little more determined, a little more serious.
He had changed.
And she had completely missed it.
That night, when they walked home together, Ai finally spoke.
"You’ve been like this for a while, haven’t you?"
Shin tilted his head. "Like what?"
"This." She gestured at him. "This whole... hardworking, serious, putting-in-effort thing."
Shin smiled.
And then he said—
"I guess I just wanted to see what would happen if I actually tried."
(Continued in Chapter 185.)
You said:
she realised that this wasnt the real shin, and then as he was going home she talked with him.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 185: The Shin I Know
Ai stood frozen for a moment, staring at Shin’s retreating back. The streetlights cast long shadows on the sidewalk, stretching his figure as he casually walked ahead, hands in his pockets.
Something wasn’t right.
Her heart told her so.
Yes, she had said that she liked guys who put in actual effort. She had admired Shin for being talented but always holding himself back. She thought that maybe, if he really tried, he’d be unstoppable. And now he was.
But...
This wasn’t the Shin she knew.
It wasn’t about his grades, or his kendo, or even his new, more composed attitude.
It was the way he smiled.
There was something different about it now. Before, his grin had been carefree—mischievous, full of life, full of him.
But now? It was too perfect. Too... controlled.
As if he had put on a mask.
Ai took a deep breath, then ran after him.
"Shin!" she called out.
He stopped, turning around just as she reached him.
"Hm? What’s up?"
Ai stopped a few steps away, catching her breath. "You... changed too much."
Shin blinked. "Huh? What do you mean? Didn’t you say you liked guys who actually put in effort?"
Ai hesitated. "I did. But this isn’t you."
Shin raised an eyebrow, tilting his head. "What do you mean? I’m still me."
Ai shook her head. "No, you’re not. You’re... different. You’re forcing yourself to be something you’re not."
Shin let out a small chuckle, rubbing the back of his head. "Isn’t this what you wanted? Someone who gives his all?"
Ai clenched her fists. "I wanted you to try because you wanted to, not because of something I said offhandedly!"
Silence.
The night air was cool, the faint sounds of the city filling the gap between them.
Shin looked at her, his usual playful demeanor still there—but just beneath it, there was something off.
"...So what do you want me to do?" he finally asked, his voice softer than before.
Ai exhaled. "I just... want you to be you. The real you."
Shin tilted his head, his expression unreadable.
Then, after a long pause, he let out a deep sigh and slouched his shoulders.
"...Man," he muttered, rubbing his temples. "So I went overboard, huh?"
Ai nodded. "Yeah. You did."
Shin gave a small laugh. "I guess I got too caught up in it. I thought... maybe if I really tried for once, things would be different. I didn’t think I’d lose myself in the process."
Ai smiled softly. "I don’t want you to be someone else, Shin. I liked you before, even when you were lazy and stupid and always messing around. That was still you."
Shin looked at her for a moment.
Then, a familiar, genuine grin spread across his face.
"Alright, alright," he said, stretching his arms. "I’ll tone it down. But I’m not going back to being completely lazy, got it? That would just make me look stupid after all this."
Ai giggled. "That’s fine. Just be yourself."
Shin smirked. "Heh. I should’ve known you’d notice."
"Of course I would." Ai flicked his forehead. "I know you, dummy."
Shin chuckled, rubbing his forehead. "Well, at least now I don’t have to keep up the act anymore. That was exhausting."
Ai shook her head, amused.
As they started walking again, Shin suddenly glanced at her.
"...Hey, Ai."
"Hm?"
Shin stuffed his hands in his pockets, looking ahead.
"...Thanks."
Ai blinked. Then, she smiled.
"Anytime, Shin."
And just like that, things went back to the way they were.
(Continued in Chapter 186.)
You said:
a weekend with no one at nohara's residence and ai shows up.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 186: Just the Two of Us
It was rare.
Almost impossible, really.
But for once, the Nohara residence was completely empty.
Misae and Hiroshi had gone on a short trip to visit some relatives, leaving their beloved children behind. But with Hima having a sleepover at a friend’s house, that left Shin alone for the weekend.
A dream come true.
Or so he thought.
As he lay sprawled across the living room floor, watching TV with an open bag of chips beside him, he felt at peace. No annoying responsibilities. No school. No nagging parents.
Just him, his snacks, and his freedom.
Until the doorbell rang.
Shin frowned, stuffing another chip into his mouth before lazily rolling over to check the time. 4:30 PM.
He wasn’t expecting anyone.
Curious, he dragged himself up and shuffled toward the door. He peeked through the peephole.
His eyes widened.
Standing outside, in a cute off-shoulder summer dress, her long dark hair tied in a side ponytail, was none other than Ai Suotome.
Shin raised an eyebrow.
“What the hell is she doing here?” he muttered before sighing and opening the door.
Ai smiled sweetly at him. "Yo, Shin~"
Shin blinked. "Oi. What are you doing here?"
Ai tilted her head innocently. "I was passing by and thought, ‘Hey, I wonder what my lovely boyfriend is up to?’ So I decided to visit!"
Shin squinted. "You were passing by a residential area you have no business in?"
Ai giggled. "Details, details~ Now, are you going to invite me in or let me stand out here like a lost child?"
Shin sighed. "Fine. But don’t break anything."
Ai entered with a cheerful hum, slipping off her sandals and stepping inside. She looked around with curious eyes. "Wow, your house is... exactly how I expected it to be."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "Meaning?"
Ai placed a hand on her hip. "Messy, kind of childish, and surprisingly cozy."
Shin smirked. "Heh. Welcome to the Nohara lifestyle."
Ai turned to him, grinning. "So? What were you up to?"
Shin stretched. "Nothing. Just chilling."
Ai’s eyes sparkled mischievously. "Then let’s do something fun!"
Shin groaned. "I knew you were gonna say that."
Ai pouted. "Oh, come on! You’re home alone for the entire weekend. You have your girlfriend over. And all you wanna do is laze around?"
Shin yawned. "That was the plan, yeah."
Ai crossed her arms. "Hmph. Unacceptable. We’re doing something!"
Shin sighed, rubbing his head. "Fine, fine. What do you wanna do?"
Ai smirked. "Let’s cook dinner together!"
Shin blinked. "What?"
Ai clapped her hands. "Yup! I’ll cook, and you help me."
Shin deadpanned. "You mean I do all the work while you pretend to be a chef?"
Ai gasped dramatically. "How dare you! I’ll have you know I’m an excellent cook!"
Shin smirked. "Yeah? What’s your specialty? Instant ramen?"
Ai puffed her cheeks. "Just wait, Nohara. I’ll show you."
And so, somehow, Shin found himself in the kitchen.
Ai wore one of Misae’s spare aprons—pink with little cat prints on it—while Shin stood next to her, arms crossed.
She turned to him, grinning. "Alright, assistant! Let’s get started!"
Shin groaned. "Kill me."
Thirty Minutes Later...
Smoke filled the kitchen.
A pot was bubbling over. A frying pan was on fire.
And Shin was just standing there, watching the chaos unfold.
Ai, covered in flour, coughed. "O-Okay! I might have miscalculated something..."
Shin sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "We’re ordering takeout."
Ai pouted. "But—"
"Nope."
"But I—"
"Not negotiable."
"...Fine."
An Hour Later...
Sitting together in the living room, the two ate from takeout containers, sipping on soda.
Ai sighed. "That was a disaster..."
Shin smirked. "Told ya."
Ai playfully nudged him. "You could’ve at least helped more!"
Shin chuckled. "Helping you burn the house down? No thanks."
Ai rolled her eyes but smiled. "Well... this is nice too."
Shin looked at her.
She had a small, content smile as she sipped her drink.
For a moment, he just watched her.
He didn’t know what it was, but...
Something about this felt comfortable.
Not dramatic, not overly exciting—just them, spending time together.
Shin smirked. "Oi, Ai."
"Hm?"
"...You really like hanging out at my place, huh?"
Ai grinned. "Of course! It’s fun teasing you."
Shin snorted. "Yeah, yeah."
Silence settled between them. A comfortable one.
Then Ai softly said, "I like being around you, Shin."
Shin blinked.
Ai turned to him, smiling warmly. "Even when we’re not doing anything crazy... I like just being here."
Shin stared at her for a moment.
Then, without thinking, he reached out and flicked her forehead.
"Ow!" Ai yelped, rubbing her forehead. "What was that for?!"
Shin smirked. "For being cheesy."
Ai pouted. "You’re the worst."
Shin grinned. "And yet, you’re here."
Ai huffed. "Yeah, yeah..."
Shin leaned back, hands behind his head.
This weekend was turning out to be... not so bad.
(Continued in Chapter 187.)
You said:
its time to sleep... or is it.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 187: A Night to Remember... or Regret?
The night had settled over the Nohara household.
Outside, the cicadas buzzed faintly, and a soft summer breeze drifted through the slightly open window. The clock ticked past 11:30 PM.
Shin stretched lazily, yawning. "Alright, that’s enough excitement for one day. Time to sleep."
He stood up, only to realize Ai hadn’t moved.
She was sitting cross-legged on the floor, hugging a cushion, looking at him with a smirk.
Shin narrowed his eyes. "What?"
Ai tilted her head. "You really think I’m just gonna leave?"
Shin raised an eyebrow. "Uh, yeah?"
Ai grinned. "Oh, Shin, Shin, Shin. You poor, clueless fool. I’m staying over tonight."
Shin blinked. "Hah?"
Ai kicked her feet playfully. "What? You’re home alone. Your parents and Hima aren’t coming back till tomorrow. And it’s so late! Wouldn’t it be dangerous for a delicate girl like me to walk home at this hour?"
Shin deadpanned. "Ai. You live in a mansion with private drivers."
Ai placed a hand on her chest dramatically. "Oh my, but what if something happens on the way? Wouldn’t you, as my dear boyfriend, feel guilty?"
Shin sighed. "You just wanna mess with me, don’t you?"
Ai smirked. "Obviously."
Shin groaned. "Fine. Stay over. Whatever. But don’t break anything."
Ai’s eyes sparkled. "Yay! Sleepover!"
Shin rolled his eyes and grabbed a futon. "Alright, I’ll sleep here in the living room. You take my room."
Ai blinked. "What?"
Shin yawned. "You heard me. You take my bed. I’ll crash on the floor."
Ai stared at him for a moment. Then, slowly, her lips curled into a smirk.
She leaned closer. "Oh~? Are you scared, Shin-chan? Afraid of sleeping in the same room as your girlfriend?"
Shin’s eye twitched. "Oi. Don’t say weird things."
Ai giggled. "You’re no fun. But fine, fine~ I’ll sleep in your room like a good guest."
Shin exhaled in relief. "Good."
And so, the two prepared for bed.
Ai borrowed one of Misae’s oversized T-shirts as pajamas. Meanwhile, Shin threw on some casual shorts and a loose T-shirt.
As Ai climbed into Shin’s bed, she grinned. "Heh. This smells like you."
Shin, already heading for the door, deadpanned. "Don’t say stuff like that before bed."
Ai giggled. "Goodnight, Shin-chan~"
Shin sighed. "Goodnight, Ai."
And with that, he left, closing the door behind him.
—
Or so he thought.
Because a few hours later…
Shin stirred awake.
Something wasn’t right.
His futon felt heavier than usual.
There was something warm next to him.
And that’s when he heard it—soft breathing.
Shin slowly opened his eyes.
Ai.
Right there.
Lying beside him.
Asleep.
Shin froze.
His mind short-circuited.
"...The hell."
Ai was curled up under the blanket, her head resting on the same pillow as him, her breathing soft and steady.
She had snuck out of his room and slipped under the covers beside him.
Shin slowly turned his head toward her.
Her face was peaceful.
Her long hair spread across the pillow.
Her hands tucked under her cheek like a sleeping cat.
And Shin?
Shin was internally screaming.
(What. The. Hell.)
(AI. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!)
(CAN YOU NOT SLEEP IN YOUR OWN DAMN ROOM?!)
Shin took a deep breath.
Stay calm.
Stay composed.
You are a man of culture and control.
You will not panic.
Then Ai shifted in her sleep, and her leg brushed against his.
Shin flinched.
His soul left his body.
NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.
He gently lifted the blanket, preparing to escape.
But at that moment—
Ai moved closer.
And suddenly, her hand rested on his chest.
Shin froze.
(OH. HELL. NO.)
His brain was going haywire.
(HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?!)
(HOW DID SHE END UP LIKE THIS?!)
(DID SHE PLAN THIS?!)
(AI, YOU DEVIL!)
His body refused to move.
And then—
Ai, still half-asleep, mumbled softly:
"Mmm… Shin…"
Shin’s soul left his body for the second time.
(OH GOD. OH GOD. OH GOD.)
(DO. NOT. FREAK. OUT.)
(DO. NOT. MAKE. A SOUND.)
(SURVIVAL MODE: ACTIVATED.)
Very, very carefully, Shin began inching away.
Just a few centimeters.
Just a little bit more.
Almost there.
And then—
Ai’s eyes fluttered open.
Shin stiffened.
Ai blinked sleepily.
Then, her lips curled into a slow, mischievous smile.
"...Hehe. Caught you."
Shin internally screamed.
(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 188.)
You said:
now chapter 188, shin moves back, but ai moves closer and shin can no longer hold back.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 188: The Breaking Point
Shin moved back.
Ai moved closer.
Shin moved back again.
Ai moved even closer.
Shin's back hit the edge of the futon.
Trapped.
Ai’s smirk widened, her eyes twinkling with pure mischief.
"Nowhere to run, huh~?" she whispered.
Shin gulped.
His mind screamed at him to stay composed, to act normal, but his body betrayed him—his heartbeat picked up speed, his face heated up, and his breathing turned shallow.
(AI. YOU ARE PLAYING A VERY DANGEROUS GAME.)
(AI. STOP. RETREAT. RETREAT NOW.)
But Ai was not retreating.
Oh no.
She was advancing.
She rested her chin on her hands, staring at him like a predator who had finally cornered her prey.
"Shin~" she sang his name softly, teasingly.
"Wh-What?" Shin croaked, his voice betraying him.
Ai pouted dramatically. "Why are you running away? Aren’t we dating?"
Shin narrowed his eyes. "Yeah, but you’re acting weird."
Ai giggled. "Weird? How so?"
She inched even closer.
Shin leaned back instinctively—but there was no more room.
Ai’s face was so close now.
Too close.
Shin could feel her breath.
His body stiffened.
(OH HELL. SHE’S TOO CLOSE.)
(WHY IS SHE SO CLOSE?!)
(WHERE IS MY ESCAPE ROUTE?!)
Ai tilted her head slightly. "You’re blushing, Shin-chan."
Shin flinched. "No, I’m not!"
Ai smiled. "Oh? Then why won’t you look me in the eyes?"
Shin clenched his fists. This girl.
She was toying with him.
He was sure of it.
But then—
Ai did something unexpected.
She lifted a hand—
And gently placed it on his cheek.
Shin's breath hitched.
Ai’s fingers were soft, her touch delicate.
She was serious now.
"Shin," she whispered, her teasing tone fading.
Shin swallowed. "…What?"
Ai gazed at him, her usual playfulness replaced by something deeper.
"You’re always holding back," she said softly.
Shin blinked.
Ai’s fingers traced his cheek, her touch gentle, slow.
"You never show your full self. You never let go. Not even with me," she murmured. "Even after we started dating… you’re still holding back."
Shin’s chest tightened.
His usual defenses, the ones he used to brush things off, to laugh things away, to play dumb, felt… weak in front of her right now.
She saw through him.
She always did.
And now, she was calling him out on it.
Shin exhaled slowly.
For a moment, the two just stared at each other.
Then—
Shin moved.
Before his mind could stop him.
Before he could overthink it.
Before she could tease him again.
He closed the distance.
And kissed her.
It wasn’t planned.
It wasn’t calculated.
It was just—
Pure instinct.
For the first time, Shin stopped holding back.
And Ai?
Her eyes widened slightly in surprise—just for a second.
Then, she melted into it.
The teasing, the mischief, the games—all of it faded away.
In this moment, there was no need for words.
No need for teasing.
No need for pretending.
Just them.
Ai's fingers curled slightly against his cheek.
Shin could feel her warmth, her heartbeat, her breath.
And for once—
he wasn’t flustered.
He wasn’t running away.
He wasn’t hiding.
He was just… Shin.
The kiss lasted only a few seconds—
But it felt like time had stopped.
When they finally pulled away, neither of them spoke.
They just looked at each other.
Ai’s face was slightly red, her lips slightly parted in surprise.
Shin smirked.
"…Happy now?" he asked, voice low.
Ai blinked.
Then, slowly, her lips curled into a real smile.
Not a smirk.
Not a teasing grin.
Just a soft, genuine smile.
"Yeah," she whispered.
Shin exhaled.
Then—
Ai’s teasing side returned.
She smirked.
"See? You should’ve done that sooner."
Shin groaned. "And there it is."
Ai giggled. "Aww, are you flustered now, Shin-chan~?"
Shin rolled over and pulled the blanket over his head.
"Goodnight."
Ai giggled harder. "Hehe, fine, fine~ I’ll behave. For now."
Shin sighed, but a small smile played at his lips.
For the first time… he felt truly at ease.
(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 189.)

next morning shin teased her, as to how now that she is alone with him, and after what happened last night he doesnt need to hold back, not in the slightest.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 189: A Taste of Her Own Medicine
The morning sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow over the room. The air was still, calm, almost peaceful—
Almost.
Ai slowly blinked awake, her body stretching slightly under the blanket as she let out a small yawn.
For a moment, everything was still normal.
Then—
A voice whispered near her ear.
"Good morning, Ai-chan~"
Ai’s entire body froze.
Her eyes widened, her sleepiness vanishing instantly.
Wait.
That voice.
That tone.
That dangerous tone.
Slowly—very slowly—she turned her head.
And there, lying beside her, his face mere inches away, was none other than Shin Nohara.
Grinning.
Smug.
Too smug.
Ai’s heart skipped a beat.
Not because of the closeness—no, she had teased him way worse before.
Not because of the way he was staring at her—no, she had endured his looks before.
It was because—
This was not the Shin she was used to.
This Shin—
This smirking, confident, dangerous Shin—
Was teasing her.
And not in the usual dumb way.
In the way that she teased him.
Ai’s lips parted slightly in shock. "Shin…?"
Shin’s smirk grew wider.
He leaned in closer.
Too close.
Way too close.
Ai instinctively scooted back, only to realize—
There was nowhere to go.
She was trapped.
Her back hit the edge of the futon.
Shin chuckled. "Nowhere to run, huh?"
Ai's eyes widened further.
Wait.
WAIT.
This—this was exactly what she said to him last night.
Was he—
Was he turning her own words against her?!
Before she could process, Shin lifted a hand—
And gently placed it against her cheek.
Ai flinched.
Shin raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What’s this?"
His tone was too casual, too amused.
Ai narrowed her eyes in suspicion.
This wasn’t right.
This wasn’t how things were supposed to go.
She was supposed to be the one teasing him.
She was supposed to be in control.
Not him.
Never him.
Ai forced herself to calm down.
She refused to let Shin get the upper hand.
She cleared her throat and smirked, flipping her hair back. "My, my, Shin-chan. Waking up like this, touching my face… are you getting bold?"
She expected him to stutter.
To blush.
To get flustered and back off.
But—
Shin’s smirk didn’t fade.
If anything—
It grew wider.
"Yeah," he said simply. "What about it?"
Ai’s smirk dropped instantly.
(WHAT.)
(WHAT DID HE JUST SAY.)
Her mind blanked.
She opened her mouth—closed it—opened it again.
Shin chuckled. "Oh? No comeback? That’s rare."
Ai gritted her teeth.
No.
No, she wouldn’t lose.
Not like this.
Not to him.
She inhaled deeply, gathering her confidence. "You’re acting pretty different today, Shin-chan~" she said, her voice silky smooth. "Did last night change something in you?"
Shin tilted his head, pretending to think. "Hmm. Maybe."
Ai smirked. "Oh? And what exactly changed?"
Shin grinned.
Then—
He leaned in.
Even closer.
Ai barely had time to react before—
His lips brushed against her ear.
Her breath hitched.
Shin’s voice dropped into a low whisper.
"Now that we’re dating," he murmured, "I don’t have to hold back anymore."
Ai’s entire body stiffened.
Shin pulled back slightly, just enough to watch her reaction.
She was completely frozen.
Her cheeks?
Bright red.
Her lips?
Slightly parted in shock.
Her eyes?
Wide.
Shin smirked.
(Ah. So this is what it feels like to be on the other side.)
He liked it.
Ai finally snapped out of it.
Her face twisted into horror.
"Wait," she gasped. "WAIT—ARE YOU TEASING ME?!"
Shin grinned.
"Yeah," he said. "What about it?"
Ai’s soul left her body.
No.
No, no, no.
This wasn’t supposed to happen.
This wasn’t how things worked.
Shin was supposed to be flustered.
Not her.
"Y-You—!" Ai pointed an accusing finger at him, her voice cracking. "Who taught you this?! WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO TEASE LIKE THIS?!"
Shin shrugged. "You."
Ai gasped.
Shin sat up and stretched lazily, acting as if he hadn’t just wrecked her entire existence.
"Welp," he said, casually standing up. "I’m gonna go make breakfast. Try not to die from embarrassment, okay?"
He walked out, completely victorious.
Ai stared after him, completely dazed.
Her mind was replaying everything.
Shin.
Teasing her.
Shin.
Getting the upper hand.
Shin.
Smirking like that.
Ai slowly fell back onto the futon, staring at the ceiling.
Her lips twitched.
Then—
She grinned.
A slow, mischievous grin.
"Oh ho ho~" she whispered. "So that’s how we’re playing it now, huh?"
She sat up.
Her eyes sparkled.
"Alright then, Shin-chan," she murmured.
"If you’re not holding back anymore…"
Her smirk widened.
"Then neither am I."

they enjoyed their day, before sunset hima returned back. and when she entered she saw the 2 of them in a compremising position.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 190: Caught in the Act…?
The day had gone by in a blur.
After breakfast, Ai and Shin spent their time lazing around, occasionally teasing each other but mostly just enjoying each other's company.
Shin, for once, didn’t feel like going out or causing trouble—not when he could just stay home and relax with Ai.
Ai, on the other hand, had been plotting her counterattack ever since the morning.
She was not going to let Shin get away with his sudden personality switch from earlier.
But before she could execute her master plan, the afternoon had already begun to fade, and soon—
The sunset arrived.
And with it—
Himawari Nohara.
The front door clicked open.
"I'm homeeee~" Hima’s voice rang through the house.
She took off her shoes, humming to herself as she walked in.
Everything seemed normal.
Too normal.
Hima blinked.
Something felt off.
Usually, if Shin-chan was home, he’d already be annoying her by now.
Yet—
Silence.
A very suspicious silence.
Narrowing her eyes, she moved further inside.
And that’s when she heard it.
A soft giggle from the living room.
Hima raised an eyebrow.
Wait.
That wasn't her brother.
That sounded like—
She turned the corner and—
Her brain short-circuited.
There, on the couch—
Shin was sitting.
Ai was practically on top of him.
Their faces—way too close.
Ai’s hands?
Pressed against his chest.
Shin’s hands?
Holding her waist.
And worst of all—
Their expressions.
Shin?
Slightly smirking.
Ai?
Mischievous.
They looked like they had been play-fighting or—
Or—
Or something worse.
Hima’s brain froze.
Then—
A deep breath—
And—
"WHAT THE HELL AM I LOOKING AT?!"
Both Ai and Shin’s heads snapped toward her.
They blinked.
Hima pointed at them, her face bright red.
"WHAT—IS—THIS?!"
Shin and Ai looked at each other.
Then back at Hima.
Then—
Shin grinned.
"Oh hey, Hima," he greeted casually. "You’re back early."
Hima’s jaw dropped.
"THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?!"
Ai, instead of panicking, simply smirked.
"My, my~" she said playfully. "Hima-chan, you shouldn't interrupt couples when they’re having a moment, you know~"
Hima screamed internally.
Her innocent eyes.
Her pure soul.
Both were under attack.
From her own brother, no less.
Shin, still grinning, leaned back against the couch.
"What’s the big deal?" he said lazily. "It’s just Ai."
"JUST AI?!?" Hima’s voice cracked. "YOU WERE—YOU WERE—"
She pointed wildly at them.
Ai tilted her head innocently.
"Hmm? What were we doing, Hima-chan?"
Hima froze.
Wait.
Now that she thought about it—
What were they actually doing?
It looked suspicious, but…
There was no actual proof.
Hima narrowed her eyes.
Ai’s smug smile told her everything.
This was a setup.
She had walked straight into their trap.
Hima gritted her teeth.
"Fine," she muttered. "Whatever."
She took a deep breath and pointed at Shin.
"You," she declared. "We are talking about this later."
Shin stretched lazily.
"Sure, sure."
Hima turned to Ai.
"And you," she said darkly. "Stay away from my innocent brother."
Ai giggled.
"But Hima-chan~" she said sweetly, "your 'innocent' brother was the one who confessed to me first, remember~?"
Hima’s soul shattered.
She let out a strangled scream and stormed off to her room.
As soon as she was gone, Ai turned to Shin with a smirk.
"That was fun~" she sang.
Shin yawned. "Hima's pretty easy to mess with."
Ai giggled.
"Ne, Shin-chan~" she cooed, leaning closer again.
Shin raised an eyebrow.
Ai's smirk deepened.
"Now… about where we left off~"
Shin blinked.
Then—
His face burned red.
"Oi—"
"Too late~" Ai purred, pinning him down again.
(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 191.)

the romantic tension in the grp was started to become evident. now that shin stoped holding back, he was filrting and almost cuddling with her tooo much. now chapter 191.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 191: The Nohara Effect
The shift was undeniable.
Ever since Shin finally stopped pretending and let loose, the entire friend group felt it.
Before, his reactions to Ai’s flirting had been mixed—sometimes ignoring her, sometimes getting flustered, and sometimes just outright acting dense.
But now?
Shin didn’t even hesitate.
He flirted back, openly.
He teased Ai, constantly.
And, worst of all—
He touched her way too much.
An arm around her waist.
 Fingers brushing through her hair.
 His head resting on her shoulder.
 Even straight-up pulling her onto his lap when she least expected it.
Ai was suffering.
Not because she didn’t like it—oh no, she loved every second of it—
But because she was not used to Shin-chan actually fighting back.
And it was killing her.
But the real victims?
The rest of the friend group.
"Oi, you two, knock it off," Kazama muttered, visibly uncomfortable, as Shin leaned lazily against Ai, his head comfortably resting on her lap during lunch.
Ai ran her fingers through Shin’s hair, humming in satisfaction.
"I don’t see a problem~" she said sweetly.
"There is a problem," Nene groaned. "You guys are too much!"
Masao looked genuinely distressed.
Bo-chan just blinked.
"You’re polluting the air with romance," Kazama grumbled, stabbing at his food. "It’s disgusting."
Shin peeked one eye open.
"Eh? But Kazama, I thought you liked mature, grown-up relationships," he said, smirking.
Kazama twitched.
"You two are acting like a damn married couple, not high school students!"
Ai giggled, but Shin smirked wider.
"Maybe we’re just built different, Kazama~"
Kazama visibly shivered.
Masao, still struggling to process what was happening, muttered, "I don’t think I can eat anymore…"
But the worst part of it all?
Shin’s boldness was infectious.
The entire group dynamic was changing.
Nene and Masao’s usual bickering?
It started shifting into something else.
Instead of just yelling at Masao, Nene had started calling him out in a different way.
"Masao, you’re so useless," she huffed. "How are you ever going to protect your future girlfriend like this?"
Masao turned bright red.
"WH-WHAT FUTURE GIRLFRIEND?!"
Nene smirked.
"Who knows? Maybe you’ll get one someday~"
Masao choked on his rice.
Meanwhile, Bo-chan started observing everything.
And, for some reason, he started staring at Kazama more than usual.
Kazama was deeply disturbed.
"Bo-chan, why do you keep looking at me like that?"
Bo-chan tilted his head.
"Shin-chan and Ai-chan are always together," he said, his voice as monotone as ever.
Kazama blinked.
"Yeah, so?"
Bo-chan stared a little longer.
"Then who is your Ai-chan, Kazama?"
Kazama froze.
The entire group exploded.
"BO-CHAN, WHAT THE HELL?!" Kazama shouted, face red.
Masao wheezed.
Nene cackled.
Ai giggled uncontrollably.
And Shin?
Shin just smirked knowingly.
"Yeah, Kazama~" he teased. "Who’s your Ai-chan?"
Kazama looked like he was about to flip the table.
"You—! I—! THIS IS WHY I HATE YOU!"
And just like that, the group descended into chaos.
Again.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 192: The Bo-chan Awakening
Something was happening.
Something dangerous.
Something unpredictable.
Bo-chan—silent, mysterious, Bo-chan—had started observing Rika.
And it was terrifying.
Not for Rika.
Not for Bo-chan.
But for everyone else.
Because Bo-chan, for the first time in his entire life, was showing interest in something.
Or rather—someone.
And nobody knew what to do about it.

It started subtly.
Rika was chatting with Nene at lunch, completely unaware of what was happening.
Meanwhile, Bo-chan sat across from her, quietly eating his food.
And staring.
Unblinking.
Completely motionless.
Just.
Staring.
At Rika.
Kazama noticed first.
And immediately started sweating.
"...Bo-chan," Kazama whispered, leaning in. "Why are you looking at Rika like that?"
Bo-chan didn’t even blink.
"...She’s interesting," he said.
The entire group froze.
Rika, finally noticing the intense stare, turned to look at Bo-chan.
"...Huh?" she blinked. "What do you mean?"
Bo-chan took a slow bite of his food.
Chewed.
Swallowed.
Then said:
"I’m gathering data."
Silence.
Absolute silence.
Shin was the first to burst out laughing.
"PFFT—GATHERING DATA?!"
Ai giggled, covering her mouth.
Nene slammed her hands on the table.
"BO-CHAN, WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!"
Bo-chan tilted his head.
"I’m observing."
Rika blinked.
"Observing what?"
Bo-chan took another slow bite.
"Your behavior."
"...Why?"
Bo-chan, deadpan as ever, said:
"To understand romance."
Everyone lost their minds.
Kazama spilled his drink.
Masao choked on air.
Nene screamed.
Rika turned bright red.
And Shin?
Shin just grinned.
"Bo-chan, buddy," he said, wrapping an arm around him, "are you finally entering your romantic awakening arc?"
Bo-chan blinked slowly.
"...Perhaps."
Kazama was horrified.
"OH GOD NO."
Nene looked excited.
"This is huge. This is insane. This is history in the making."
Masao, still recovering, muttered, "I don’t think I’m ready for this timeline…"
Meanwhile, Rika, still processing, cleared her throat.
"So… uh… Bo-chan?"
Bo-chan blinked at her.
"Yes."
"...Are you interested in me?"
The group went silent.
Everyone leaned in.
Bo-chan, completely calm, took another slow bite of his food.
Then, without hesitation, he said:
"...Undecided."
The cafeteria erupted.
Kazama collapsed onto the table.
Nene was laughing so hard she couldn’t breathe.
Masao was in shock.
Ai and Shin high-fived.
And Rika?
She just stared at Bo-chan in disbelief.
"...Undecided?!"
Bo-chan nodded.
"I require more data."
Rika gawked.
"I—what—BO-CHAN, YOU’RE TREATING ME LIKE A SCIENCE PROJECT?!"
Bo-chan took another bite.
"Possibly."
Rika turned to Shin.
"SHIN-CHAN, CONTROL YOUR FRIEND."
Shin just grinned.
"Hey, hey~ don’t look at me. This is fascinating."
Rika buried her face in her hands.
"Oh my god, I can’t believe I’m being analyzed by Bo-chan."
Meanwhile, Bo-chan just sat there, completely unbothered.
And continued his research.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 194: Shin and the Father-In-Law Arc Begins
Shin had never been the type to plan things out.
He just existed, went with the flow, and let life unfold however it wanted.
So when he found himself alone after school, with the rest of the group mysteriously occupied, he shrugged and decided to head to the mall.
No reason. No purpose. Just vibes.
But fate had other plans.
Because when he casually strolled into a clothing store—one he absolutely had no business being in—he was immediately met with a sight so bizarre, so ridiculous, that he had to double-take.
A group of tall, muscular, dead-serious-looking men in black suits stood in the middle of the store.
…Specifically, in the teen girls’ section.
Shin froze.
His brain short-circuited.
And then, as if things couldn’t get any weirder—
Right in the middle of those big scary men was a very familiar man.
Ai’s father.
Looking at skirts.
Shin stared.
Ai’s father stared back.
A long, painful silence stretched between them.
Then, in the most serious, businesslike tone possible, Ai’s father finally said:
"…Shinnosuke."
Shin tilted his head.
"…Bossman."
Another silence.
And then, Ai’s father—this powerful, high-status, no-nonsense CEO—casually lifted a frilly pink dress and asked, completely straight-faced:
"Do you think Ai would like this?"
Shin blinked.
Then blinked again.
Then, after exactly three seconds of mental buffering, he burst out laughing.
"OH MY GOD, YOU’RE BUYING CLOTHES FOR AI-CHAN?!"
Ai’s father nodded.
"Yes. It has been three years. I have missed several birthdays. I must compensate."
Shin wiped a tear from his eye.
"You’re buying her teen girl outfits to compensate?"
Ai’s father frowned, turning the dress over.
"Are these not appropriate?"
Shin peered at it.
"Well… they’re cute, but I dunno if she’d wear something that frilly."
Ai’s father nodded seriously.
"Noted."
Then he turned and signaled to his men.
"Erase the frilly options. Find something more elegant."
The men immediately began reorganizing the racks, moving with military precision.
Shin watched in disbelief.
"Dude… You’re treating this like a full-scale operation."
Ai’s father nodded.
"Naturally. My daughter’s happiness is at stake."
Shin chuckled, stuffing his hands into his pockets.
"Man, you really love Ai-chan, huh?"
Ai’s father turned to look at him.
For a moment, there was something unreadable in his gaze.
And then, after a long pause, he said:
"…More than anything."
Shin’s grin softened.
"Heh. Yeah. I get that."
Ai’s father studied him carefully.
Then, as if making some sort of decision, he suddenly asked:
"Do you drink, Shinnosuke?"
Shin blinked.
"Uh. I’m in high school."
Ai’s father nodded approvingly.
"Good answer. Let’s get some food instead."
Shin tilted his head.
"Huh?"
Ai’s father turned to his men.
"Continue shopping. I am taking Shinnosuke for dinner."
The men immediately bowed.
"Understood, sir."
Shin blinked again.
"Dinner?"
Ai’s father turned back to him.
"Yes. I have decided to bond with my future son-in-law."
Silence.
A very long, awkward silence.
Shin, for once in his life, was caught completely off guard.
Then, with zero hesitation, he said:
"…Oh. So you already consider me family?"
Ai’s father smiled.
"Do you not?"
Shin stared at him.
Then, after a beat, he grinned.
"…Heh. Yeah. I guess I do."
And just like that—
Shin and Ai’s father became buddies.

Chapter 195: The Unexpected Duo
Dinner with Ai’s father.
Now, if Shin had to be honest, he never imagined himself in this situation.
Actually, no one would have imagined this situation.
But here he was.
Sitting in an expensive restaurant, across from the CEO of a massive conglomerate, eating the most expensive steak he had ever seen in his life.
And the weirdest part?
It wasn’t awkward.
It was actually… kind of fun?
"So," Ai’s father said, cutting into his steak with the precision of a seasoned assassin, "How did you and Ai start dating?"
Shin blinked.
Chewed slowly.
Swallowed.
"Uh… Well, she confessed to me in kindergarten first—"
Ai’s father nodded.
"Yes. I am aware."
Shin scratched his cheek.
"Then she moved away. Came back. Kept chasing me again. I never really thought about it until one day, I kinda realized that I liked her too. Then we talked. And then I said I loved her."
Ai’s father stared at him.
Then he narrowed his eyes.
"You make it sound too simple."
Shin smirked.
"It was simple."
Ai’s father tapped his fingers against the table, thinking.
"…You did not make her cry, did you?"
Shin chuckled.
"I mean… she was definitely flustered."
Ai’s father stared harder.
Shin grinned.
"Don’t worry. It was a good kind of flustered."
Ai’s father sighed, taking a sip of his wine.
"You truly are impossible to read."
Shin leaned back in his chair.
"Yeah, I get that a lot."
Silence stretched between them for a moment.
Then Ai’s father suddenly asked, "Are you taking care of her?"
Shin tilted his head.
"I mean, yeah? But Ai-chan’s not fragile. She can handle herself."
Ai’s father hummed in agreement.
"That is true. She is strong. However, strength does not mean she does not need support."
Shin’s grin softened slightly.
"Yeah. I know."
Ai’s father studied him.
Then, as if satisfied, he nodded and returned to his meal.
And just like that, they fell into a surprisingly comfortable conversation.
They talked about random things—Shin’s school life, Hima, Ai’s ridiculous spending habits, the stress of running a corporation.
Shin couldn’t believe it.
This serious, intimidating man was actually pretty chill.
By the time they finished their meal, Shin found himself actually enjoying the guy’s company.
And Ai’s father?
Well, he had never expected to enjoy talking to his daughter’s boyfriend either.
But here they were.
As they left the restaurant, Ai’s father suddenly said:
"Come with me."
Shin blinked.
"Uh. Where?"
"The mall. I still have not completed my task."
Shin smirked.
"…You need help picking out clothes, don’t you?"
Ai’s father exhaled.
"It appears I am… inefficient in this area."
Shin chuckled.
"Alright, alright. I got you, Bossman."
And so, the most unexpected shopping trip in history began.
At the Mall…
"Alright, first rule," Shin said, holding up a bright pink, glitter-covered hoodie.
Ai’s father stared at it.
Shin tossed it aside.
"Never buy something that looks like it was made for a five-year-old’s birthday party."
Ai’s father nodded seriously.
"Understood."
Shin then picked up a more subtle, elegant dress.
"Something like this is more Ai-chan’s style. Classy, but not too over-the-top."
Ai’s father examined it carefully.
"…You seem experienced in this."
Shin shrugged.
"Well, I’ve bought clothes for Hima before. I know what looks good and what doesn’t."
Ai’s father smirked.
"So you are saying I should trust your judgment?"
Shin grinned.
"Obviously. Who knows Ai-chan better than me?"
Ai’s father chuckled.
For the first time in years, he felt like he had a real conversation with someone without formalities.
By the end of the night, they had bought enough clothes to fill an entire closet.
And as they walked out of the mall, Ai’s father suddenly said:
"You are a strange one, Shinnosuke."
Shin smirked.
"Yeah. I hear that a lot."
Ai’s father turned to him.
"I approve of you."
Shin raised an eyebrow.
"You do?"
Ai’s father nodded.
"Yes. You are a good match for my daughter."
Shin grinned.
"Well, glad to have your blessing, Bossman."
Ai’s father smirked.
"Bossman, huh?"
Shin shrugged.
"Well, I can’t just call you ‘Dad’ yet, right?"
Ai’s father chuckled.
Shin laughed.
And just like that, the most unexpected friendship in history was formed.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 196: A Drunken CEO and One Very Amused Boyfriend
Shin never thought he'd see the day when he had to carry a drunk billionaire home like a dazed salaryman after a failed Friday night.
Yet here he was.
Dragging Aikawa Renji, the CEO of Aikawa Global Holdings, through the streets of Kasukabe, while the man drunkenly mumbled about stocks, mergers, and the meaning of life.
But let’s rewind a little.
Two Hours Earlier…
After their unexpected bonding session at the mall—where Renji basically bought Ai an entire new wardrobe—he suddenly turned to Shin with a serious expression.
"Let’s get a drink."
Shin blinked.
"A drink?"
Renji nodded, adjusting his expensive, custom-tailored suit.
"A man-to-man drink."
Shin stared.
Then smirked.
"Alright. But I’m still in high school, you know?"
Renji waved it off.
"I know a place."
The Bar…
And that was how they ended up in a high-end lounge where the lights were dim, the music was soft, and the entire vibe screamed "rich people do business here."
Shin felt super out of place.
Renji, on the other hand?
Completely at home.
He ordered a whiskey.
Shin, being the responsible one, ordered a mojito.
"You’re not drinking anything stronger?" Renji asked, raising an eyebrow.
Shin smirked.
"I like my brain cells, thanks."
Renji chuckled.
Then he took his first sip.
And another.
And another.
One Hour Later…
Shin sat back, watching in amusement as Renji slammed his glass on the table, looking way too emotional for a guy who usually looked like he could buy the entire country if he wanted.
"You know…" Renji mumbled, his voice slightly slurred, "I really love Ai."
Shin nodded.
"Yeah. I figured."
Renji squinted at him.
"I never had time for her. I was always away. Always working."
Shin said nothing.
Renji exhaled.
"I missed so much of her life. And yet, she still grew up into a perfect, intelligent, wonderful daughter."
Shin smiled slightly.
"Yeah. She did."
Renji leaned closer.
"You know what?"
Shin raised an eyebrow.
Renji slammed a hand on his shoulder.
"YOU’RE A GOOD KID, SHINNOSUKE."
Shin flinched at the sudden volume.
"Uh. Thanks, Bossman."
Renji pointed dramatically at him.
"I TRUST YOU WITH MY DAUGHTER."
Shin chuckled.
"Glad to hear it."
Then Renji suddenly slumped against the table.
Shin blinked.
Looked at the empty bottle of whiskey.
Then at the drunk CEO, who was now muttering about the stock market in his sleep.
Shin sighed.
"…This is gonna be a pain, huh?"
Back at Ai’s Mansion…
Shin half-dragged, half-carried Renji to the front door.
Ai opened it, looking at Shin first.
Then at her disheveled, half-conscious father.
Then back at Shin.
Shin gave her a sheepish grin.
"Uh. So… Bossman had a bit too much to drink."
Ai sighed.
"You let him drink?!"
Shin held up his hands.
"Hey, I only had a mojito! He’s the one who went full "I’m-a-CEO-so-let-me-drown-in-whiskey" mode!"
Ai facepalmed.
Then sighed again.
"Alright, just bring him in."
Inside Ai’s Mansion…
Shin and Ai dragged Renji to the couch.
The man mumbled something about stocks and fatherhood, then immediately passed out.
Shin stretched his arms.
"Well. That was an experience."
Ai crossed her arms, looking at her unconscious father.
"He’s always like this when he drinks. That’s why he rarely does it."
Shin chuckled.
"Yeah. I figured."
Ai looked at him.
Then suddenly, smirked.
"You had fun, didn’t you?"
Shin smirked back.
"Not gonna lie? Yeah. Your dad’s kinda cool when he’s not acting like some CEO overlord."
Ai rolled her eyes.
"Don’t let him hear you say that. He’ll get smug about it."
Shin laughed.
"Too late. He already called me a ‘good kid’ and said he trusts me with you."
Ai blinked.
Then her face turned slightly red.
"He… He did?"
Shin nodded.
"Yup."
Ai looked at her father, her expression softening slightly.
Then she turned back to Shin.
"Thanks for taking care of him."
Shin grinned.
"No problem. But next time, I’m making you do it."
Ai chuckled.
"Deal."
And with that, the night came to a chaotic, but oddly heartwarming end.
(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 197.)
You said:
the homeroom teacher passed forms for deciding what the students are planning on persuing in the future. the grp disscuss over lunch. shin jokes initially but after ai said something he gave it some thought. now chapter 197.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 197: The Future? Yeah… That’s a Tough One
Homeroom that day was the usual mix of chaos and boredom.
Their teacher, Yoshinaga-sensei, stood at the front of the classroom, waving a stack of papers in the air like they were some divine decree.
"Alright, everyone! It's time to start thinking about your future careers!"
A collective groan spread through the room.
Yoshinaga-sensei ignored it.
"These forms will help you decide what paths you might want to take after high school. University? Vocational school? Straight into the workforce? Start thinking about it now!"
She walked through the aisles, passing the papers around.
Shin took one, staring at it like it was a death sentence.
Lunchtime—The Group Gathers
Under the cherry blossom tree in the courtyard, Shin and the rest of the group sat in their usual spot, bento boxes open, forms scattered around them.
Kazama adjusted his tie, looking way too serious for lunch.
"This is a very important decision," he declared, pushing up imaginary glasses.
Nene nodded, munching on a sandwich.
"I already know what I want to do," she said confidently. "I’m going into entertainment!"
Masao wiped his forehead.
"I just want a stable job where I won’t get fired…"
Bo chewed slowly, then nodded.
"Same."
Kazama sighed.
"You all should take this more seriously. A good career is everything."
Shin grinned.
"Oh? So you’re planning to be some big-shot businessman, huh?"
Kazama smirked.
"Of course. I’m already preparing for it."
Shin snickered.
"Bet you have a five-year plan, huh?"
Kazama crossed his arms.
"Try a twenty-year plan."
Shin burst out laughing.
Shin's 'Plan' (Or Lack Thereof)
Ai glanced at Shin, tilting her head.
"And what about you, Shin-chan?"
Shin leaned back against the tree, grinning lazily.
"Me? Oh, I dunno. Maybe I'll be a professional butt-dancer."
Kazama facepalmed.
"Shin…"
"Or maybe a stay-at-home husband. That sounds fun."
Ai huffed.
"How can you not take this seriously?"
Shin blinked.
Ai stared at him, her tone more gentle than scolding.
"I mean… You’re really smart, Shin-chan. Even if you don’t act like it. You’re talented, too. So why would you waste it?"
Something about the way she said it made him pause.
It wasn’t mocking.
It wasn’t nagging.
It was just genuine curiosity.
For once, Shin didn’t have a joke.
He just sat there, looking at his form, feeling…
Weird.
Later That Evening
Back home, Shin lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling.
His career form sat on his desk, untouched.
Hima peeked in.
"Onii-chan? You’re not asleep?"
Shin looked at her.
Then sighed.
"Hey, Hima… What do you wanna be when you grow up?"
Hima beamed.
"A princess!"
Shin snorted.
"Nice. Solid plan."
Hima frowned.
"But what about you?"
Shin stared at the ceiling.
For once… he didn’t have an answer.
(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 198.)
You said:
shin started to ask around what he wanted to do, from his friends(especially kazama), his parents, and even later a meeting with Renji ai's father and he was actually concerned and serious. he wanted to continue kendo, but didnt was commited on becoming a sports person. he also liked to work for himself too. he found a hint to his answer with ai. now chapter 198.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 198: The Search for an Answer
The question lingered in Shin’s mind longer than he expected.
At first, he thought it was something he could just joke about and move on, but after Ai’s words, he started to feel a little uneasy.
For once in his life, Shin Nohara was taking something seriously.
And that in itself was terrifying.

Step One: The Friends
During lunch, he leaned towards Kazama, completely ignoring the fact that Kazama was in the middle of eating.
"Oi, future CEO. What do you think I should do in life?"
Kazama stopped, blinked, and put down his chopsticks.
"...Did you just ask me a serious question?"
Shin nodded.
Kazama’s face lit up like he just won the lottery.
"Finally! You’re thinking about your future!" He grabbed Shin’s hands with both of his. "Shin, listen to me! You have intelligence, charisma, and—"
"Okay, stop flirting with me, Kazama."
Kazama immediately let go and scowled.
"Ugh, why do I even bother?"
Still, Kazama sighed and adjusted his tie.
"In all honesty, Shin, you should do something where you’re independent. You hate authority, you only work hard when you care about something, and you’re surprisingly good at business-related things."
Shin tilted his head.
"Wait, I am?"
Kazama nodded.
"Yes. You don’t study, yet you understand economics when it’s explained to you, and you’re ridiculously good at negotiation. You’d be wasted in a normal desk job."
Shin considered this.
He did like doing things his own way.
But still… something was missing.

Step Two: The Parents
That evening, he tried asking Hiroshi and Misae.
"Mom, Dad, what do you think I should do in the future?"
Hiroshi, who was half-asleep on the couch, peeked one eye open.
"Huh? Oh. That’s rare. You actually care about this stuff?"
Misae, who was reading a magazine, also perked up.
"Shin-chan, if you really have something you want to do, go for it. But if you’re just asking because of some assignment, just write something normal like ‘salaryman’ and call it a day."
Shin pouted.
"That’s so boring."
Hiroshi scratched his chin.
"Well, what do you like?"
Shin thought about it.
"I like Kendo."
They both nodded.
"Okay, so become an athlete."
"But I don’t wanna just do sports."
"...Okay, so not that."
Shin sighed.
"Man, this is tough."
Misae smiled.
"Don’t rush it. You’ll figure it out."

Step Three: Renji Aihara
A few days later, Shin found himself in a fancy restaurant, across from Ai’s father, Renji Aihara.
The man took a sip of his wine, looking at Shin with sharp eyes.
"So, Ai told me you were actually thinking about your future. I almost didn’t believe her."
Shin grinned.
"Yeah, yeah, shocker, I know."
Renji chuckled.
"Alright, so what’s bothering you?"
Shin leaned forward.
"I wanna keep doing Kendo. But I don’t wanna just be an athlete. I wanna work for myself, but I don’t know in what way."
Renji nodded, thinking.
"Do you enjoy teaching?"
Shin paused.
"...I never thought about it."
Renji smirked.
"You like mentoring people, don’t you? You’ve been protecting Hima and helping others your whole life. If you combine that with your love for Kendo, maybe you’ll find an answer."
Shin blinked.
Something about that felt right.
Like a piece of the puzzle was clicking into place.

Step Four: Ai
That night, as they walked home, Ai glanced at him.
"You’re thinking hard about this, huh?"
Shin sighed.
"Yeah. You’re annoyingly the reason why."
Ai giggled.
"I’m glad. It’s about time you stopped holding back."
Shin smirked.
"Oi, don’t make me sweep you off your feet right here."
Ai rolled her eyes.
"But seriously, Shin-chan… whatever you decide, I know you’ll be amazing at it."
Shin looked at her.
She really meant it.
He felt his heart thump.
Maybe… just maybe…
He was starting to see an answer.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 199.)
You said:
shin in his room at night, after long planning came into something satifing. he was going to pusue science, like deep into science. with this he after completling his studies and higher studies with a masters, he had an opportunity to become a uni professor. at the same time if he continued kendo and felt like pusing it he could always shift. and he was excellent and gifted in both math and sciences. and about working alone, he can do researches at the same time. after thinking this he sat there and got bit emotional about himself, realising this isnt who use to be. so serious, so goal orientied. he immedeatly then calls ai for her opinion. continuechapter 199.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 199: A Future Set in Motion
Shin lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling.
For the first time in his life, he had actually planned something far ahead.
Not just a joke answer. Not just something to scribble on a form.
A real future.
And surprisingly… he liked it.

The Plan
Science.
He was ridiculously good at it, and he had never even tried that hard.
Math and physics came naturally to him. Chemistry too, when he wasn’t slacking off.
And if he went deep into it, he could eventually become a university professor.
At the same time, he could still pursue Kendo if he wanted to.
If, at some point, he felt like shifting, he had a clear path.
And the best part?
He could still work alone when he wanted to.
Research, experimentation, deep thinking— it all fit him strangely well.
Shin leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.
He let out a deep breath.

The Realization
He was not the same person he used to be.
There was a time when he wouldn’t have even cared about something like this.
He had always drifted through life, doing things when he wanted, however he wanted.
But now…
Now he was thinking seriously.
He felt goal-oriented.
He felt… responsible.
A weird, almost nostalgic feeling bubbled in his chest.
Had he really changed this much?
For the first time in years, he felt emotional about himself.
And he didn’t like dwelling on it alone.
So, without thinking, he grabbed his phone and dialed.

The Call
"Shin-chan? It’s late. What’s up?"
Ai’s voice was soft and sleepy on the other end.
Shin hesitated for a second before sighing.
"Oi, Ai… Do you think I’ve changed?"
There was a pause.
Then, a sleepy giggle.
"Eh? What kind of deep question is that in the middle of the night?"
Shin rubbed the back of his neck.
"I dunno… I was just thinking about the future and stuff, and I realized I’m not the same idiot I used to be."
Ai hummed.
"Well… you’re still an idiot."
"Oi—"
"But…" Her voice softened. "Yeah. You’ve changed, Shin-chan. In a good way."
Shin leaned back against the headboard.
"Good, huh?"
Ai smiled through the phone.
"Mhm. So, what’s this big realization of yours?"
Shin exhaled.
"I think… I’m gonna pursue science. Like, deep into it."
There was a pause.
Then—
"…You’re serious?"
"Yeah."
Another pause.
Then, Ai gasped dramatically.
"Who are you, and what have you done with Shin-chan?!"
Shin snorted.
"Oi, shut up."
Ai giggled.
"But seriously, that’s amazing, Shin-chan. I always knew you were smart, but hearing you actually talk about it like this… it makes me really happy."
Shin’s face felt a little warm.
He rubbed his nose.
"Oi, don’t get all sappy on me now."
Ai giggled again.
"I mean it. You’re gonna do great things."
Shin lay back down, a small smile on his face.
"Yeah. Guess I just needed to hear that."
They talked for a little longer—small things, playful teasing, and comfortable silence.
Eventually, Ai yawned.
"Alright, alright, future scientist. I need sleep."
Shin chuckled.
"Yeah, yeah. Night, Ai."
"Goodnight, Shin-chan."
As the call ended, Shin let out one last deep breath.
He had a path forward.
And strangely… it didn’t feel scary at all.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 200.)
You said:
he shared his plan with everyone. even his teacher felt proud of him, and he took it sincerly instead of flexing. ai father even adviced if he ever felt like working for him or getting help for studies abroad, he shouldnt hesitate, they were almost family.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 200: Shin Nohara’s Future
For the first time in his life, Shin voluntarily stood in front of his friends, his class, his teacher, and his family—
And seriously shared his plan for the future.

The Classroom Reaction
“So,” Shin said casually, hands in his pockets, standing before his group of friends at lunch. “I’m thinking of pursuing science. Maybe even becoming a professor.”
Silence.
Absolute silence.
Then—
“WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!”
Nene spit out her juice. Kazama dropped his chopsticks. Masao just stared. Bo simply blinked.
Even Ai, who had already known, giggled at their reactions.
Kazama was the first to snap out of it.
“You? A professor?!” he exclaimed. “Are you serious?”
Shin gave him a lazy smirk.
“Yup. Science. Math. Physics. All that deep nerdy stuff.”
Kazama looked like he was about to explode.
“You… you…” He grabbed Shin by the shoulders. “You had this potential all this time, and you wasted it?! Do you know how many times I told you to take school seriously? And now you suddenly decide this?!”
Shin grinned.
“Well, yeah. Better late than never, right?”
Kazama looked like he wanted to strangle him and hug him at the same time.
Nene was still recovering from shock.
“Wait, wait, wait! You mean to tell me the guy who spent years drawing butts on test papers is suddenly going to become a scholar?!”
Shin shrugged.
“Hey, if I was that smart while slacking off, imagine what I can do if I actually tried.”
Masao wiped a tear.
“This is the biggest character development I’ve ever seen…”
Bo simply gave a thumbs-up.
Ai smiled.
“Shin-chan, I’m really proud of you.”
Shin scratched his cheek.
“Yeah, yeah. No need to get all emotional on me.”
But despite his words, a part of him felt… warm.

His Teacher’s Response
Later, when Shin handed in his form, his homeroom teacher read it twice.
Then looked at Shin.
Then read it again.
“…Are you sure this is your form?” he asked.
Shin smirked.
“Yup. Science all the way, sensei.”
The teacher leaned back in his chair, genuinely stunned.
“…Shin-kun, I always knew you had the brains for it, but I never expected you to actually use them.”
Shin chuckled.
“Yeah, neither did I.”
His teacher set the paper down and smiled.
“I’m proud of you, Nohara.”
For once, Shin didn’t take it as a joke.
He didn’t flex.
He didn’t make a dumb comment.
Instead, he bowed his head slightly in gratitude.
“…Thanks, sensei.”
And just like that, his teacher saw a glimpse of the man Shin was becoming.

A Conversation With Ai’s Father
That evening, Shin met Renji Aihara for tea at his mansion.
Renji listened quietly as Shin explained his future plans.
When Shin finished, the man nodded approvingly.
“I see… So you finally found a path.”
Shin took a sip of his tea.
“Yeah. Took me a while, though.”
Renji smirked.
“Some men take years to figure it out. You? You’re ahead of the curve.”
Then, leaning forward, he continued—
“If you ever decide to study abroad, or if you need any connections for research, don’t hesitate to come to me.”
Shin blinked.
“Eh?”
Renji chuckled.
“I mean it. You’re almost family, after all.”
Shin raised an eyebrow.
“…Are you sure you want a guy like me as family?”
Renji laughed.
“I’ve never been more sure of anything.”
Shin scratched his nose, feeling oddly touched.
“…Thanks, old man.”
Renji’s eyebrow twitched.
“…What did you just call me?”
Shin smirked.
“Oops, did I say that out loud?”
“Damn brat.”
Ai, watching from a distance, giggled.
Her father and boyfriend had truly become close.

A New Beginning
That night, as Shin lay in bed, staring at the ceiling—
He felt something different.
For the first time, his future wasn’t uncertain.
He had a goal.
He had people who believed in him.
And most importantly—
He believed in himself.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 201.)
You said:
next chapter the rest of the grp also submitted their goals to teacher, disscussing what it is, keep it close to who they are, and what their interest are and their personalities, but also that will work out for them in the future. continue chapter 201.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 201: Everyone’s Future
The next day, after Shin had submitted his form, the rest of the group found themselves doing the same.
And, naturally, they discussed it over lunch.

Kazama’s Path: The One Everyone Expected
Kazama adjusted his tie with pride.
“Well, as you all should have guessed, I’ve chosen to pursue economics and business management.”
No one was surprised.
“Wow,” Shin deadpanned. “I’m shocked.”
“Truly a twist we never saw coming,” Nene added sarcastically.
Kazama shot them both a glare.
“Mock me all you want, but my future is secure. My family runs a successful business, and I plan to expand it even further.” He pushed his glasses up—only to remember he doesn’t wear glasses anymore. He awkwardly lowered his hand.
Ai nodded.
“It suits you, Kazama-kun. You’re good with finances, and you enjoy strategic planning.”
Kazama smirked.
“Of course. Unlike a certain someone here, I’ve always been serious about my future.”
Shin grinned.
“Yup, and look where it got you. Bald at 17.”
“I AM NOT BALD!”
The lunch table erupted in laughter.

Nene’s Choice: The Unexpected but Fitting Path
Nene took a dramatic sip of her juice before announcing,
“I’ve decided to pursue literature and creative writing.”
Shin blinked.
“…Huh.”
Kazama adjusted his posture.
“…I actually didn’t expect that.”
Masao scratched his head.
“But, Nene-chan, aren’t you always saying you hate writing essays?”
Nene rolled her eyes.
“Essays are boring. Writing stories is different.”
Bo nodded in agreement.
Nene leaned forward, her voice growing more passionate.
“I’ve always loved dramas, romance, and emotions. And honestly, I think I’d be a great author or playwright.”
Ai smiled.
“I think that’s a wonderful choice, Nene-chan. You do have a talent for making people feel emotions.”
Shin, never missing a chance, added,
“Yup. Mostly anger.”
Nene punched his arm.
“See? Look how emotional I made you feel.”
Shin rubbed his arm, grinning.

Masao’s Future: A Step Toward Confidence
Masao hesitated before answering.
“…I submitted for culinary school.”
For a moment, everyone went silent.
Then—
“Masao, that’s perfect!” Ai said brightly.
Nene clapped.
“Yeah! You’re great at cooking!”
Shin smirked.
“Gotta admit, your food is the best thing about our hangouts.”
Masao’s face turned red.
“I-It’s nothing special…”
Bo simply patted Masao’s back in support.
Kazama nodded.
“It makes sense. You’ve always been more comfortable in the kitchen. If you hone your skills, you could become a professional chef.”
Masao scratched his cheek, embarrassed but deeply happy.
“…Yeah. I’d like that.”

Bo’s Decision: Simple, Yet Meaningful
Bo took a slow bite of his food.
Then, in his usual calm tone, said,
“I’m going into horticulture and environmental science.”
Once again—
Silence.
Then:
“…Okay, yeah. That actually makes sense,” Shin admitted.
Nene nodded.
“You do love plants.”
Kazama smirked.
“And you’d be excellent at it. You’re patient, knowledgeable, and observant.”
Bo nodded.
“I want to work with nature. Maybe run a botanical garden. Or study plants. Feels right.”
Ai smiled.
“I think that’s wonderful, Bo-chan.”
Shin chuckled.
“Yeah. When you’re famous, let me know. I’ll visit your farm and pretend I know what I’m talking about.”
Bo just smiled.

Ai’s Path: The Elegant, Unshakable Goal
Finally, all eyes turned to Ai.
She took a graceful sip of her tea before answering.
“As I’ve always planned, I’ll take over my family’s business and lead it to greater heights.”
No one was surprised.
Kazama grinned.
“Of course. That’s a given.”
Ai smiled.
“My father has trained me for this since I was a child. I intend to prove myself.”
Shin leaned forward, resting his chin on his hand.
“So, CEO Ai-chan, huh?”
Ai smirked.
“Of course.”
Shin grinned.
“Well, when I’m a professor and you’re a CEO, we should go on lunch breaks together.”
Ai’s eyes twinkled.
“Are you asking me on a business date, Shin-chan?”
Shin shrugged.
“Eh. You can call it that.”
The group groaned.
“Stop flirting during serious discussions!” Nene whined.

A Future That Feels Right
As the conversation wrapped up, the group looked at each other—
And realized something important.
They weren’t just talking about the future anymore.
They were actively walking toward it.
There was no fear.
No uncertainty.
Only excitement for what lay ahead.
Shin smirked, looking at his friends.
“…Man, we’re growing up, huh?”
Kazama sighed.
“Yeah. And it’s terrifying.”
Ai giggled.
“But also thrilling.”
Masao nodded.
“I just hope we can still eat lunch together like this.”
Bo gave a thumbs-up.
Shin stretched, grinning.
“Well, even if we all go our separate ways… you guys can’t get rid of me that easily.”
And with that, the group laughed, enjoying the moment.
The future was waiting.
But for now—
They’d cherish the present.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 202.)
You said:
shin researched actually thinking of pursuing a bachelors and masters degree abroad, a degree with math, physics, and probably a bit of engineering. kazama and ai got wind of it and they told how they were planning the same and so they started their reserach and prep.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 202: The Study Abroad Plan
Shin had never thought of himself as a serious student. Sure, he was smart—way smarter than most people gave him credit for—but he had never felt the need to push himself.
Until now.
The thought of pursuing a degree that combined math, physics, and a bit of engineering had started as a small curiosity. But the more he researched, the more excited he became.
He wanted to challenge himself.
 He wanted to see how far he could go.
And after looking into some of the top universities…
He started to seriously consider studying abroad.

Kazama and Ai Catch On
It wasn’t long before Kazama and Ai caught wind of his research.
Kazama, ever the academic, immediately pounced on the topic.
“You’re thinking of going abroad for your studies?” he asked, adjusting his tie with a keen interest.
Shin leaned back in his chair.
“Yeah. It’s just a thought for now. But it seems… interesting.”
Kazama smirked.
“You do realize that studying abroad means going through a highly competitive admissions process, right?”
Shin shrugged.
“Yeah. But that’s not really a problem.”
Kazama froze.
“...Wait, are you actually serious?”
Shin grinned.
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
Kazama stared at him.
Then, without another word, he sat down and pulled out his laptop.
“…What are you doing?” Shin asked.
Kazama adjusted his posture.
“Well, if you’re serious about this, then I’m doing my own research. I’ve always planned to study abroad, but if you’re going too, then I might as well refine my choices.”
Shin smirked.
“Oh? So you need me there?”
Kazama scoffed.
“Don’t flatter yourself. I just need to make sure you don’t embarrass yourself.”
Shin laughed.
“You’re just afraid I’ll get into a better university than you.”
Kazama twitched.
“That will never happen.”
Before the argument could escalate, Ai entered the room.
“What are you two talking about?” she asked, her eyes sharp with curiosity.
Kazama looked up.
“Shin is thinking of studying abroad.”
Ai’s eyes widened.
“…Really?”
Shin nodded.
“Yeah. I’m looking into it. It seems like a good option.”
Ai’s gaze softened.
“…Then I suppose we should start preparing together.”
Shin blinked.
“…Wait, you too?”
Ai smiled.
“Of course. I’ve always planned to take over my father’s company, but studying at a top international university will help with that.”
She tilted her head slightly.
“But knowing that you are considering it too… it makes me happy.”
Kazama crossed his arms.
“Looks like all three of us are aiming for the top, huh?”
Ai nodded.
“It seems that way.”
Shin scratched his head, looking at them both.
“…You two are really serious about this, huh?”
Ai chuckled.
“And you’re not?”
Shin smirked.
“Well, I guess I am now.”

The Preparation Begins
From that moment on, the three of them started their research and preparation.
SATs, TOEFL, application essays, scholarships, university rankings—
Suddenly, lunch breaks and study sessions were filled with endless discussions about which universities were the best fit.
Kazama was meticulous, creating detailed spreadsheets with deadlines and requirements.
Ai was efficient, leveraging her family connections to gather insider information on top institutions.
And Shin?
Despite his usual laid-back nature, he threw himself into the process with a quiet intensity.
He wasn’t just doing this for fun.
For the first time in a long time…
He was genuinely excited about his future.
And he wasn’t alone.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 203.)
You said:
shin reveled this to his parents, and how ai and kazama are joining in them probably planning on goin to the same uni. hima heard it and was excited about her brother, but she realised kazama will also be leaving not sure when will he come back. she kept this feeling to herself only for now.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 203: Family Reactions & Unspoken Feelings
Shin knew he had to tell his parents.
They’d always been lenient with him—more than most parents would be with a kid like him. But this was big.
He was planning to study abroad.
For years.
It wasn’t just some small change—it was a decision that would shape his entire future.
So, after dinner one evening, he finally brought it up.

The Nohara Family’s Reaction
Misae and Hiroshi sat across from him at the dining table, listening intently.
“So…” Hiroshi scratched his chin. “You’re thinking of going overseas for college?”
“Yeah.” Shin nodded. “I’ve been looking into it seriously, and Ai and Kazama are planning the same thing. We might even end up at the same university.”
Misae blinked.
“…Wait, you?”
Shin sighed.
“Yes, me.”
His mother looked as if she’d seen a ghost.
“You, who used to struggle with just putting on pants properly in the morning, are now planning to go overseas for higher education??”
Shin deadpanned.
“I don’t struggle with pants anymore.”
Hiroshi smirked.
“Sometimes you do.”
Shin rolled his eyes.
Misae put a hand to her forehead.
“I’m not against it, Shin-chan. I just… I guess I’m a little surprised. You always seemed so relaxed about school. It’s hard to imagine you going off to study at some elite foreign university.”
Shin leaned back in his chair.
“Well… I guess I just found something I actually want to do.”
Misae and Hiroshi looked at him.
It was subtle, but there was something different in Shin’s expression.
Something serious.
For once, their son wasn’t just joking around or dodging responsibility.
He had thought this through.
And he had made up his mind.
Hiroshi finally exhaled, smiling a little.
“Well, if that’s what you really want… then we’ll support you.”
Shin looked at his father.
“You’re cool with it?”
Hiroshi nodded.
“Of course. It’s a great opportunity.”
Misae folded her arms, still processing it all.
“Well, if Ai-chan is going too, I guess I feel a bit more relieved. But don’t think you can slack off just because you’re smart, Shin-chan. Universities abroad don’t go easy on people.”
Shin smirked.
“I know, I know.”

Hima’s Excitement… and Hidden Worry
While the parents were discussing things, a pair of big, brown eyes peeked from the doorway.
Himawari had been listening the whole time.
And when she finally heard her brother say he was planning to study abroad, she ran up to him.
“Shin-nii! You’re going to university overseas?!”
Shin glanced at her and grinned.
“Yup.”
Hima lit up.
“That’s so cool! You’re going to be like one of those smart university guys in the movies!”
Shin laughed.
“Well, obviously. I was born a genius, you know.”
Hima giggled.
“I’m so proud of you, Shin-nii! You’re actually thinking about your future!”
Shin smirked.
“Hey, I’ve always been a responsible guy.”
Hima tilted her head.
“Didn’t you once say your dream job was being a ‘sexy lifeguard’?”
Shin coughed.
“…We don’t talk about the past.”
Hima giggled again.
She was truly happy for her brother.
But as she kept thinking about it…
She realized Kazama was also leaving.
And she didn’t know when he’d come back.
Her smile faltered just a little.
But she didn’t say anything.
She kept the feeling to herself…
For now.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 204.)
You said:
next day ai saw hima a bit down during lunch, so she decided to talk with her, with only the girls present, to figure out the problem. chapter 204.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 204: A Sister’s Worries
Lunchtime at school was usually a lively affair, filled with Shin’s dumb jokes, Nene’s complaints, and Masao’s panic over forgetting his lunch money.
But today, Himawari sat quietly, barely touching her food.
Ai noticed it immediately.
She’d gotten to know Hima well over the past few months. Usually, she was cheerful, sharp-witted, and full of energy. But today… she was different.
So, when the opportunity arose, Ai gently pulled Hima aside—just the girls.

The Girls' Talk
They found a quiet corner outside, near the school garden. The air was crisp, and a soft breeze rustled the trees.
Ai crouched a little to be at eye level with Hima.
“Hima-chan, you seem a bit down today. What’s wrong?”
Nene, Rika, and the other girls stood nearby, giving her space but still listening.
Hima hesitated for a moment, biting her lip.
“…It’s nothing.”
Ai smiled gently.
“Hima-chan. If it was nothing, you wouldn’t look so down.”
Hima fidgeted with the hem of her uniform.
“…It’s stupid.”
Ai shook her head.
“Even if it’s stupid, if it’s bothering you, it’s not nothing.”
Hima sighed.
Then, after a long pause, she finally admitted it.
“…Kazama-san is leaving.”
Ai blinked.
“Oh.”
She hadn't expected that.
The rest of the girls exchanged glances.
Nene crossed her arms.
“Well… yeah. He and Shin are going abroad for university, right?”
Hima nodded slowly.
“I know it’s not like he’s disappearing forever. And it’s not like we talk that much, but…”
She gripped her skirt.
“I just… don’t know when I’ll see him again after he leaves.”
Her voice was small.
Ai’s eyes softened.
So that was it.
It wasn’t just about Kazama leaving.
It was about uncertainty.
Hima had grown up with Shin’s friends always around. They were like older brothers and sisters to her. And now, suddenly, one of them was leaving with no clear timeline of when they’d come back.
That kind of change… was scary.

Understanding Feelings
Ai knelt down next to her and smiled.
“Hima-chan, do you like Kazama-kun?”
Hima froze.
Her face immediately turned red.
“Wha—?! N-No! I mean… I don’t know! It’s not like that, I just—!”
She stopped herself.
Did she like Kazama?
She had never really thought about it.
Sure, she admired him. He was smart, responsible, and dependable.
And yeah, maybe she looked forward to when he visited their house.
And… okay, maybe she liked teasing him just to see his reactions.
But… was that really—?
“I don’t know,” Hima admitted quietly.
Ai chuckled.
“You don’t have to know right now.”
Hima looked up at her.
Ai smiled.
“Feelings are complicated. Sometimes you don’t realize how much you care about someone until they’re about to leave.”
Nene nodded, smirking.
“Yeah, it took Ai-chan forever to realize how much she liked Shin.”
Ai coughed.
“T-That’s different!”
Hima blinked.
“…Is it?”
Ai opened her mouth—then stopped.
Hima grinned.
“See? Even you don’t know.”
Ai pouted.
Nene and the other girls giggled.
The mood felt lighter now.

The Little Sister’s Resolve
After a moment, Hima let out a deep breath.
“…I guess I’ll just make the most of the time left, then.”
Ai nodded.
“That’s a good idea.”
Hima smiled slightly.
Then she looked at Ai, tilting her head.
“But Ai-nee, aren’t you going too?”
Ai blinked.
“…Huh?”
Hima’s eyes twinkled mischievously.
“Well, you’re going to the same university as Shin-nii and Kazama, right?”
Ai hesitated.
“…Yeah.”
Hima grinned.
“That means I won’t see you either.”
Ai’s heart squeezed.
For the first time, she realized—
It wasn’t just about Shin.
She was going to be leaving Hima behind too.
And suddenly…
She didn’t feel so sure anymore.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 205.)
You said:
the girls decieded a plan to bring kazama and hima together.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 205: The Plan Begins
After their conversation with Hima, the girls exchanged knowing glances.
Nene crossed her arms.
“So, we all agree, right?”
Rika smirked.
“Yep. This is a clear case of someone not realizing their feelings.”
Ai nodded.
“She might not be sure now, but if we don’t do something, she’ll just bottle it up until Kazama’s already gone.”
The group huddled together, whispering excitedly.
It was time for Operation: Hima and Kazama.

Step 1: Awareness
The first step was simple—make Hima realize just how much she cared.
Ai started by casually bringing up Kazama in conversations.
“Hima-chan, did you know Kazama-kun ranked first in the recent exams?”
Hima shrugged. “Of course, he did.”
“He’s also really into classic literature,” Ai added.
Hima blinked. “Really? That does suit him…”
Nene joined in.
“You know, he’s also really bad with horror movies. He won’t admit it, but he totally freezes up.”
Hima perked up.
“…Seriously?”
“Oh yeah,” Ai nodded. “It’s adorable.”
Hima stared at them.
Then, without realizing it, she muttered—
“That does sound kinda cute…”
Pause.
Her eyes widened in horror.
The girls grinned.
Step one: Success.

Step 2: The Setup
Next, they needed Kazama to spend more time with Hima—alone.
They started orchestrating little moments:
“Accidentally” leaving them alone.


If the group walked home together, someone would “suddenly” remember they forgot something, leaving Kazama and Hima to walk alone.


If they ate lunch as a group, someone would “run off to buy drinks,” leaving the two alone.


Casual physical contact.


Ai would “accidentally” push Hima closer to Kazama in crowded hallways.


Rika would suggest group activities where pairing up was required—and somehow, Kazama and Hima always ended up together.


Getting Kazama to notice her.


“Did you see Hima’s new hairstyle, Kazama?” Ai would say.


“She’s really sharp in class, right?” Nene added.


The trick was subtlety.
And sure enough, Kazama started paying attention.

Step 3: The Push
Finally, they needed a real moment.
Something that would force both of them to confront their feelings.
And so…
Ai came up with the perfect plan.
A "coincidental" festival date.
She turned to the girls, eyes gleaming.
“Alright, here’s what we’re going to do—”

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 206.)
You said:
the student coucil , they themself, were planning the festival so for them to make sure it happened wasnt that difficult, what was difficult was the actual confessing, and a biggest hurdle, SHINCHAN.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 206: The Ultimate Obstacle—Shinchan
The girls’ plan was airtight.
The Student Council was already in charge of organizing the festival, so setting up the "perfect" moment for Kazama and Hima was easy.
All they had to do was:
 ✔ Ensure Kazama and Hima went together.
 ✔ Set the mood.
 ✔ Give them the final push.
Everything was perfect.
…Until they remembered one major problem.
Shinchan.

The Shinchan Factor
Hima was Shinchan’s beloved little sister.
Kazama was Shinchan’s best friend.
And if anyone could completely derail a romantic confession…
It was him.
“Wait, wait, wait—what if Shin ruins it?” Nene suddenly realized.
The group froze.
Ai sighed, rubbing her temples.
“...He is unpredictable.”
“He’s gonna make fun of them,” Rika added.
“And if he finds out it’s a setup—” Nene’s face paled.
They all knew.
If Shinchan found out about their plan, he’d either:
Completely hijack it and turn it into a joke.


Interrupt at the worst possible moment.


Tease Kazama until he physically combusted.


The worst part?
He wouldn’t even do it on purpose.

Phase 1: Distracting the Disaster
“We need to get rid of Shin before Kazama and Hima’s moment,” Ai declared.
Nene nodded. “Agreed.”
“But how?” Rika asked. “You can’t just tell him not to do something.”
“If anything, that makes him more interested,” Ai sighed.
The group brainstormed.
Then—
Nene smirked.
“What if we distract him?”

Phase 2: The Perfect Bait
The plan was simple.
Find something that completely absorbs Shinchan’s attention.


Keep him away from Kazama and Hima.


Make sure he’s too busy to even notice what’s happening.


And what better way to do that…
Than Ai herself?
Ai smirked. “Shin might not care about romance, but he does care about me.”
The others blinked.
“…Ai-chan, are you sacrificing yourself?” Nene asked.
Ai flipped her hair.
“Not a sacrifice. Just… strategic flirting.”
She turned to the group, determined.
“I’ll keep him occupied. You guys handle the rest.”
The plan was set.
Now all they had to do…
Was pull it off.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 207.)
You said:
the festival day, came but one of the girls, rika, didnt knew that things were about to change for her too this festival, but for now we look at hima and kazama.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 207: The Festival Begins—A Change for Rika?
The school festival had finally arrived.
Students ran around, making last-minute adjustments to their booths, decorations, and performances. The entire school was buzzing with excitement.
For most people, this was just another festival.
For Hima and Kazama, it was going to be something much, much more.
And yet—
One person didn’t know that things were about to change for her too.
Rika.
But for now…
The focus was on Hima and Kazama.

The Setup
Everything was in place.
The girls had successfully manipulated the schedule so that Kazama and Hima would spend the festival together.
They were partners for the Student Council patrol, assigned to check booths and events together.
They would:
 ✔ Walk around the festival together.
 ✔ Share food.
 ✔ Get dragged into fun activities.
 ✔ Experience the romantic festival atmosphere.
All perfectly staged for a confession.
…If Kazama didn’t chicken out.

The Shinchan Distraction Plan
Meanwhile, Ai was executing Phase 1: Keep Shinchan Away.
Ai: “Shin, let’s go check out the haunted house.”
Shinchan: “Ai-chan, are you scared? Want me to protect you?” (smirks)
Ai: “No, I just figured you’d love seeing high school girls screaming.”
Shinchan: “…”
Shinchan: “We’re going. Immediately.”
Plan successful.
With Shin occupied, the others could now focus on Kazama and Hima.

The Festival Date Begins
Hima and Kazama walked side by side through the festival.
Hima: “You don’t have to be so stiff, Kazama-nii.” (laughs)
Kazama: “I-I'm not stiff! This is just how I walk.”
Hima smiled as she watched Kazama try to act composed.
But she could tell—
He was nervous.
They visited different booths, played festival games, and even shared a crepe.
Hima: “Kazama-nii, say ‘Ahh~’” (holding out a piece of crepe)
Kazama: “…Ahh—wait, why am I doing this!?”
Hima giggled. “You already took a bite, so why are you complaining now?”
Kazama turned red.

The Unexpected Change—Rika’s Moment
While all this was happening, Rika was enjoying the festival by herself.
She wasn’t particularly looking for romance.
But that day, something happened.
Someone—unexpected—noticed her.
And by the end of the day…
Rika’s festival would never be the same.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 208.)
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 208: A Quiet Observation—Bo and Rika
The festival air was thick with excitement. Laughter, the scent of food, and bursts of chatter filled the school grounds. Everywhere, students rushed between booths, dragging friends along to games, haunted houses, or food stalls.
In the midst of it all, Bo stood in his usual relaxed manner, watching.
He wasn’t particularly drawn to festivals, but the atmosphere had its own charm. The energy, the liveliness—it was nice. He had planned to just stroll around, observing everything at his own pace.
That was when he saw her.
Rika.
She was standing in front of a shooting game booth, staring at the toy prizes with an unreadable expression.
Bo wasn’t sure what made him pause.
Maybe it was how still she was, despite the chaos of the festival. Maybe it was the way her fingers slightly curled, like she was contemplating something but didn’t want to admit it.
Or maybe it was just because—
He had been noticing her a lot lately.
Bo walked over.
“You want one?”
Rika startled slightly, turning to face him. “Bo-chan?” She blinked, then glanced at the toy prizes again. “No. I was just… looking.”
Bo followed her gaze. There were plush toys of different sizes, lined up as rewards for the shooting game. Among them, a small, simple white rabbit sat in the middle row.
“Liar,” Bo said casually.
Rika scoffed. “Excuse me?”
“You want that rabbit,” he pointed out. “But you don’t want to admit it.”
She folded her arms, her lips twitching in amusement. “And how did you reach that conclusion, detective?”
Bo didn’t answer immediately. He just picked up the toy gun from the booth and handed over a ticket.
The booth attendant nodded. “Three shots. Hit the target, and you get a prize.”
Rika raised an eyebrow. “Oh? You’re trying to win it for me?”
Bo simply aimed.
The first shot—bullseye.
Rika whistled. “Not bad.”
The second shot—another hit.
“Okay, okay,” she admitted, now actually intrigued. “Didn’t expect that from you.”
Bo remained silent, lining up the last shot.
His eyes flickered toward her for a brief second.
Then, with calm precision, he pulled the trigger.
The third shot struck the target perfectly.
“Winner!” the booth attendant cheered.
Bo picked up the small white rabbit and, without hesitation, placed it in Rika’s hands.
She looked down at it, then back at him. “You really didn’t have to.”
“I know,” he said simply.
For a moment, Rika didn’t say anything. She stared at the rabbit in her hands, as if trying to figure something out. Then, with an almost sheepish chuckle, she shook her head.
“…You’re weird, Bo-chan.”
Bo tilted his head slightly. “Am I?”
She glanced at him from the corner of her eye. “Yeah. But it’s kinda nice.”
Bo didn’t reply, but a small, barely noticeable smile played on his lips.
And just like that, the festival didn’t seem so ordinary anymore.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 209.)

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 209: The Hurdle Named Nohara Shinnosuke
The festival was in full swing, the school grounds buzzing with life. Students dashed from stall to stall, dragging their friends along, laughter and excitement filling the air.
Shinchan was somewhat enjoying himself, though a part of him was also wondering why Ai had been unusually clingy today. Not that he minded.
“I’m hungry, Shin,” Ai said, linking her arm around his. “Let’s go grab something to eat.”
He raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t you just eat two takoyaki trays?”
Ai smiled sweetly. “A lady never gets full.”
“…That’s not how that works.”
Before he could argue further, she pulled him toward the food stalls, determined to keep him occupied.
But Shin’s instincts were sharper than most gave him credit for.
As they passed a small alley between the school buildings, he caught something in the corner of his eye.
Kazama.
And not just Kazama—Kazama was with Hima.
Now that was interesting.
Shin stopped walking.
Ai felt the shift immediately. Damn it. She quickly tugged his arm. “Shin, let’s—”
He turned his head ever so slightly, eyes narrowing.
“…Oi,” he muttered. “What’s my little sister doing over there?”
Ai panicked. Not yet! They haven’t reached the good part!
She had spent so much effort distracting him today. She couldn’t let all of it go to waste!
Thinking fast, she did the only thing that would guarantee his attention.
She grabbed his face with both hands, turned him toward her, and—
Pressed her lips to his.
Shin’s eyes widened slightly. Ai never made bold moves like this in public. At least, not usually.
The festival noise faded for a brief moment as she held the kiss, just long enough to keep his head firmly in place.
Then she pulled back, her cheeks flushed, but her expression smug.
Shin blinked.
“…What were we talking about?”
“Nothing important,” Ai said smoothly, wrapping her arms around his neck. “Now, let’s find dessert.”
Shin, momentarily dazed, let her lead him away.
Mission accomplished.
But Ai knew she had only bought a little time.
If she wanted to truly keep Shin occupied, she needed an even bigger move.
And she wasn’t above making one.

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 210.)

things were getting spicy between kazama and hima around this time, almost time for the sun set and the final dance of the festival, an idea suggest by nene, for reasons known. chapter 210.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 210: The Sunset Dance
As the festival reached its final hours, the sky was painted in warm shades of orange and pink, casting a dreamy glow over the school grounds. The laughter and chatter of students blended seamlessly with the music playing over the speakers, setting the perfect mood for the long-awaited final dance.
A dance suggested by Nene, for very specific reasons.
Kazama wasn’t stupid—he had suspicions about why she was so insistent on this particular event. But at this moment, he had bigger concerns.
Because standing in front of him, looking slightly nervous yet hopeful, was Hima.
“Shin-chan will be pissed,” Kazama muttered, glancing around, as if expecting the older Nohara to suddenly appear and pull him away by the collar.
Hima huffed, puffing up her cheeks. “I can decide for myself.”
“…I know,” he admitted, rubbing the back of his neck.
She was wearing a simple yet elegant yukata, her hair tied in a neat bun with a small decorative ornament. Kazama found himself staring a second longer than intended before clearing his throat.
The music changed, signaling the start of the final event. The festival committee had set up a small open space, string lights twinkling above, creating an atmosphere that felt straight out of a romance novel.
Hima looked up at him expectantly. “You’re not going to run away, are you?”
Kazama sighed. “You make me sound like a coward.”
“Well, if you don’t dance with me, that means you made yourself sound like a coward.”
“…That’s unfair.”
Hima smiled, taking a small step closer. “Then prove me wrong.”
Kazama exhaled. He was far too weak against this girl. With a reluctant yet inevitable sigh, he extended his hand.
She took it without hesitation.
And so, under the dim glow of festival lights, with the sunset as their backdrop, Kazama found himself slowly swaying to the music with Hima Nohara in his arms.
This is dangerous, he thought.
Hima, on the other hand, was thinking something else entirely.
This is nice.

Across the festival, a certain older brother was still successfully distracted.
For now.
But for how much longer?

(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 211.)

Chapter 211: Under the Festival Lights
The festival's final event had turned the school grounds into something out of a dream. Beneath the twinkling lights and the lingering hues of the sunset, couples—and potential couples—danced to the soft melody playing through the speakers.
Shin and Ai stood in the middle of the open space, Ai’s arms draped around his shoulders while his hands rested lazily on her waist. He wasn’t the most graceful dancer, but Ai had long since stopped expecting that.
“You’re enjoying this a little too much,” Shin teased, his voice low.
“And you’re taking this suspiciously well,” Ai countered, tilting her head.
“I figured I might as well let you have your moment.”
Ai rolled her eyes, but her smile never faded. “What a generous boyfriend I have.”
Meanwhile, Masao awkwardly twirled Nene, who, in contrast, was surprisingly good at leading. Rika and Bo danced a little apart from the others, and while Rika tried to act like she wasn’t affected, she was.
Bo was quiet as always, his expression unreadable.
But then—
“…Bo,” Rika murmured, looking up at him as they swayed.
He blinked, tilting his head slightly.
And then, out of nowhere—
“I like you.”
Bo’s grip on her hand tightened, just for a second.
Rika’s heartbeat pounded in her ears. She hadn’t even meant to say it, at least not now, but something about this moment, this atmosphere—it had just come out.
Bo remained silent, his gaze searching hers.
Then, ever so subtly, he nodded.
“…Me too.”
Rika’s breath hitched, and before she could say anything else, Bo did something unexpected.
He pulled her closer.
Not too much—just enough to make her realize that he meant what he said.

At the same time, in a quieter corner of the dance floor, Hima tightened her grip on Kazama’s hand.
He glanced down at her. “What?”
She hesitated for only a second before looking straight into his eyes.
“I like you.”
Kazama stiffened.
The music, the festival, the people around them—it all faded in that instant.
Hima wasn’t nervous. She wasn’t blushing, nor did she look like she was joking. She was just… sincere.
Kazama swallowed, his mind racing. But even as he opened his mouth, nothing came out.
Hima smiled. “You don’t have to say anything.”
“…That’s—”
“You can think about it,” she interrupted. “For now, just dance with me.”
Kazama exhaled sharply.
Then, with a small, almost imperceptible nod, he tightened his hold on her waist.
And so, under the festival lights, as the music carried on, words were exchanged that couldn’t be taken back.
Not that anyone wanted to take them back.

Chapter 212: A Brother’s Reaction
The festival had ended, but the impact of the night still lingered. The air was thick with unspoken words, new beginnings, and silent realizations as the group made their way home.
For Bo and Rika, things felt… different. They weren’t speaking much, but the occasional glances and small, hidden smiles were enough to confirm that something had changed between them.
Kazama, on the other hand, was completely lost in his own thoughts. Hima’s words played on repeat in his mind. I like you.
It wasn’t something he had expected, and yet, now that he looked back, maybe he should have.
Ai, of course, was entirely focused on Shin. She had successfully kept him distracted the whole night, but she knew it was only a matter of time before he realized why she had done that.
And Hima?
Hima was the most restless of them all.
She knew she had to tell Shin. It wasn’t just about Kazama—it was about her. About how she had taken a step forward in her own life, about how things were changing.
And so, when they got home, she didn’t hesitate.

Shin was lying lazily on the couch, flipping through channels with an almost bored expression. Misae and Hiroshi were already asleep, leaving only the siblings awake.
Hima stood before him, arms crossed.
“I have something to tell you.”
Shin didn’t even look away from the TV. “If you’re about to confess that you stole my pudding from the fridge, I already knew.”
“I’m serious, dummy.”
That got his attention. He turned his head slightly, raising a brow. “Alright, alright. Spill it.”
Hima took a deep breath, then met his gaze.
“I confessed to Kazama today.”
Silence.
Complete and utter silence.
Shin just… stared at her. No smirk. No teasing remark. No sudden what-the-hell-did-you-just-say reaction.
Nothing.
Hima blinked. “Uhh… Did you hear me?”
Shin nodded slowly. “Yeah, I heard you.”
More silence.
“…And?”
Shin tilted his head. “And what?”
“That’s it?!”
Shin stretched his arms above his head, yawning. “What, did you expect me to flip out or something?”
“Well, yeah! You’re my brother! You’re supposed to be all overprotective and annoying about this!”
Shin let out a small chuckle. “Hima, come on. I knew this was coming eventually.”
Hima’s face turned red. “You knew?!”
“You’re so obvious,” he snorted. “It was only a matter of time before you made a move. Actually, I’m kinda surprised it took you this long.”
Hima opened her mouth, then closed it. Then opened it again. Then—
“…Wait.” She narrowed her eyes. “Is this a trap? Are you acting all chill just to catch me off guard and then hit me with the big brother speech later?”
Shin smirked. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
Hima groaned. “Ugh! You are so annoying!”
Shin laughed, but then his expression softened just a bit. “But seriously, Hima… If it makes you happy, then I’m happy too.”
Hima paused.
She hadn’t expected that.
“…Really?”
“Yeah,” Shin shrugged. “I mean, I will kill him if he makes you cry, obviously.”
“There it is.”
“But otherwise? You do you, Hima.”
Hima bit her lip, trying not to smile. “…Thanks, Shin.”
Shin gave her a lazy salute. “Anytime, kiddo.”
Hima huffed. “I’m not a kid.”
“Uh-huh. Whatever you say.”
As Hima turned to leave, she suddenly remembered something.
“Oh, and by the way…” She smirked. “Ai totally knew about this and helped me.”
Shin blinked. “Wait. What?”
Hima skipped away before he could say another word.
“…That little—”

Chapter 213: The Aftermath of the Festival Night
The school was as lively as ever, but for those who had experienced last night’s festival, it felt like the air had changed.
People noticed.
Something was different.
Bo and Rika walked into the classroom together, side by side. It wasn’t unnatural, but there was something off about their usual dynamic. They were quieter. The way they occasionally glanced at each other, the way Bo’s usual calm expression softened just a little—people noticed.
And then there was Kazama.
Kazama, who was never one to look flustered, was definitely flustered. His sharp, composed demeanor was replaced by a slightly dazed, distracted expression. His posture was stiff, and every time he heard a giggle or a hushed whisper in class, his shoulders tensed.
Shin, of course, noticed immediately.
“…What’s up with you?” he asked, leaning against Kazama’s desk.
Kazama coughed into his fist. “Nothing.”
Shin narrowed his eyes. “Ohh, I see how it is.”
Kazama stiffened. “See what?”
Shin smirked. “Someone’s looking extra awkward today. Something happened, huh?”
Kazama gritted his teeth. “Drop it.”
Before Shin could press further, the girls walked in.
And that’s when the class really started buzzing.
Hima entered with an almost unshakable confidence—on the outside. On the inside, she was panicking. But she held her head high, glancing in Kazama’s direction for just a second before finding her seat with Ai and Nene.
The reaction was immediate.
“Wait, wait—did something happen between her and Kazama?!”
“They were together at the festival, right? Could it be—”
“They totally confessed, didn’t they?!”
The gossip spread like wildfire.
Kazama groaned, rubbing his temples. “I knew this would happen.”
Shin, sitting on his desk, was grinning from ear to ear. “Damn. The moment you get a little emotional, the whole school goes wild. Ain’t easy being the Kazama, huh?”
“Shut up.”
“Hey, I’m just enjoying the show.”
Kazama glared at him. “You don’t understand how bad this is.”
Shin raised a brow. “Oh? What’s the worst that could happen?”
At that moment, Nene turned around and slammed her hands on their desks.
“SO,” she grinned wickedly, “when’s the wedding?”
Kazama nearly choked.
Shin burst out laughing. “PFFT—”
Hima, who had just sat down, covered her face with her hands. “Nene, stop.”
“Oh no, I’m not stopping,” Nene said, eyes glinting. “This is prime entertainment. After years of dodging romance, Kazama finally—”
Ai cleared her throat loudly.
That was enough to shut Nene up—for now.
Instead, Ai simply smiled and leaned on her desk. “I think we should let them breathe for now.”
Bo, sitting quietly in his usual spot, suddenly found himself the center of attention when Rika sat down beside him.
This was normal.
But what wasn’t normal was the slight redness in Rika’s cheeks and the way Bo casually placed his arm on the desk between them, closer than usual.
And then—
“WAIT A SECOND—”
More whispers.
Bo blinked. “Hm?”
Rika, flustered, tried to ignore the stares, but it was impossible. People were already putting the pieces together.
“No way.”
“Did TWO couples form last night?!”
“Wait—so if Kazama and Hima are a thing… are Rika and Bo a thing too?!”
The sheer amount of shock in the classroom was enough to make Shin lean back and just watch.
Kazama was suffering.
Hima was dying.
Bo was just… Bo.
And Rika? Rika was trying very hard not to combust.
And then, just when things couldn’t get any worse—
Masao, completely oblivious, walked into class.
“Whoa, why is everyone so loud this morning?” he asked.
Someone immediately blurted out, “DID YOU KNOW KAZAMA AND HIMA CONFESSED?! AND BO AND RIKA TOO?”
Masao’s eyes widened. “…WHAT?!”
And that was how the whole class—and eventually, the whole school—exploded with rumors.
Meanwhile, Ai sat there, sipping her drink with a knowing smile.
Shin simply whistled.
“Welp,” he said, patting Kazama’s back, “good luck, buddy. Looks like your whole life just changed overnight.”
Kazama groaned. “I hate you.”
Shin grinned.

Chapter 214: The School’s Explosive Realization
News spread fast in high school.
It started as whispers in the classroom.
Then it spread to the hallways.
And by lunchtime, the entire school was talking about it.
“Wait, so the Student Council Vice President, Kazama-kun, is dating the Co-President’s sister?!”
“Yeah, and she’s only a first-year—”
“Wait, that’s not even the biggest news. The captain of the kendo club, Rika-senpai, is apparently dating…”
“…Just Bo.”
Silence.
Absolute, stunned silence.
“Bo.”
“Just Bo.”
“The Bo?!”
“The quiet guy who just… stands there?!”
“The Bo who doesn’t even react when you talk to him?”
“The same Bo who—”
At that moment, a few students turned their heads toward the lunch tables where the couples were seated.
Kazama, looking extremely uncomfortable, sat with his usual sharp posture but with one major difference. Hima was right next to him, closer than anyone had ever seen before. She wasn’t clinging to him, but there was an undeniable comfort between them. The kind of closeness that spoke volumes.
Meanwhile, at the other end of the cafeteria, Rika and Bo sat at their usual spot—but this time, she leaned in, speaking quietly with him. And the most insane part?
Bo. Was. Responding.
Not much, of course. But the fact that he was actively talking back to her, in his quiet, blunt way, was enough for people to freak out.
“This is actually insane.”
“First Kazama and now Bo?!”
“This is the craziest plot twist of the year.”
But that was still not all.
Because sitting right in the middle of it all, eating his lunch with an innocent, almost tragic expression—
Was Shinchan.
His head was resting on his hand, his food half-eaten, his eyes distant.
Ai was right beside him, trying to contain her laughter.
And then it started.
The whispers.
“Poor Shinchan…”
“To think his own best friend would steal his precious little sister from him.”
“The betrayal… the pain…”
“I heard he was so against it but couldn’t stop it…”
“He must be suffering.”
Shin didn’t do anything to spread these rumors. But he sure as hell didn’t stop them either.
Instead, he sighed dramatically and shook his head.
Ai narrowed her eyes. “Are you seriously playing the victim right now?”
“What do you mean?” Shin asked innocently, taking a small, pitiful bite of his food.
Ai raised an eyebrow. “You’re acting. And everyone’s eating it up.”
“No, no, Ai-chan,” Shin said with an exaggeratedly sorrowful expression. “I’m just a brother who loved his sister. And now she’s been stolen from me by my best friend. How could you expect me to be okay?”
Ai pinched the bridge of her nose. “Unbelievable.”
But it was too late.
Students were already looking at him with pure sympathy.
“Shin’s really strong for enduring this…”
“To think his own best friend would do this to him…”
“I can’t believe Kazama betrayed him like this…”
Kazama, sitting right there, nearly slammed his forehead onto the table. “Shin. I swear to god—”
“Ah,” Shin sighed deeply, eyes full of tragic acceptance, “I should’ve seen this coming… I mean, Kazama always admired my sister. I guess I just never thought it would really happen…”
Kazama clenched his jaw. “You absolute—”
Then Masao, who had been listening way too closely, wiped a tear from his eye. “Shin-chan… you’re really strong for handling this so well.”
Shin turned to him with a pained smile. “Thanks, Masao.”
Kazama stood up. “I am not—”
Before he could even finish, a random student walked by and placed a hand on Shin’s shoulder.
“…Stay strong, Nohara.”
Shin gave him a weak nod. “I’ll try.”
Kazama wanted to fight.
Hima, sitting beside him, buried her face in her hands.
Meanwhile, Bo took a sip of his drink, looking completely unbothered.
Ai just sighed.
This school was a mess.

Chapter 215: The Final Sprint Toward SATs
The shift in the school’s atmosphere was immediate.
The festival had been an explosion of emotions—confessions, unexpected new couples, and even Shin managing to milk his fake tragic brother act for all it was worth. But now, reality had crashed back down.
The SATs were looming over them like a monstrous shadow.
For most students, the tension was unbearable. But for three particular individuals—Shinchan, Ai, and Kazama—the stakes were even higher.
Because they weren’t just aiming for any university.
They were aiming for the best.
And not just in Japan.
The Study Plan Begins
It started with Ai.
As soon as she entered the classroom that morning, she slammed a thick binder onto Shin and Kazama’s desks.
“This,” she announced, adjusting her glasses, “is the official SAT battle plan.”
Shin blinked at it lazily. “Battle plan?”
Kazama leaned forward, flipping through the pages. “Wait. Did you actually make a structured study schedule for us?”
Ai crossed her arms. “Obviously.”
Kazama’s respect for her organization skills increased tenfold.
Shin, however, wasn’t as impressed. “You really expect me to follow a strict study schedule?”
Ai shot him a glare. “Yes.”
Shin smiled innocently. “Oh, sweet Ai-chan. So naive.”
Ai’s eye twitched. “I’ll make you regret that attitude.”
Kazama, wisely choosing not to get involved, examined the binder. “Alright, so we have a study group every day after school, three-hour sessions, with focus rotations between math, reading, and writing. Weekend cram sessions. And one full-length practice test every week?”
“Correct.” Ai nodded. “It’s the most effective way to prepare.”
Shin frowned. “Three hours a day? That’s so much.”
Ai placed a firm hand on his shoulder. “You’re not slacking off, Shinchan. If you want to go abroad, you have to take this seriously.”
Kazama adjusted his tie. “She’s right, Shin. If we want to get into top universities, we can’t just wing this.”
Shin sighed dramatically. “Fine, fine.” Then he raised an eyebrow. “Wait. Where are we studying?”
Ai smiled. “My house.”
Kazama looked up. “Huh?”
Shin grinned. “Oh? I like the sound of this.”
Ai’s smile twitched. “Not for fun.”
Shin shrugged. “I don’t know, Ai-chan. Studying in your room, just the three of us…” He smirked. “Sounds kinda intimate.”
Ai instantly grabbed a notebook and smacked him on the head.
“Ow!”
Kazama sighed. “I knew this was going to be a problem.”
Still, the plan was set. They would all be studying at Ai’s house after school, and for the first time in his life, Shin Nohara was going to take academics seriously.
After School at Ai’s Place
By the time they arrived at Ai’s luxurious mansion, Shin had already made himself too comfortable.
“This place still looks like it belongs in a Hollywood movie,” Shin said as he plopped onto the couch.
Kazama, meanwhile, remained standing awkwardly. “Your house is… massive.”
Ai sighed, placing study materials on the table. “Sit down, both of you. We’re starting immediately.”
Kazama sat down, opening his notebook.
Shin stretched, looking around. “Your dad’s not here, huh?”
Ai paused. “…No, he’s working late.”
Shin smirked. “Perfect. That means no distractions.”
Ai narrowed her eyes. “You are the distraction.”
Kazama cleared his throat. “Can we focus?”
Ai nodded and flipped open her textbook. “Alright. Let’s start with math.”
Shin groaned. “Math first? Ugh.”
Ai ignored him and handed them practice questions.
And so, the torture began.
Two Hours Later…
Kazama was completely absorbed in his work, solving equations with precision. Ai was reviewing her answers with confidence.
And Shin?
Shin had somehow fallen asleep on the desk, a pencil barely hanging onto his fingers.
Ai twitched.
She grabbed her notebook and smacked him on the head.
“WAH!” Shin bolted up. “What happened? Where am I?!”
“You fell asleep!” Ai scolded. “We just started, Shin!”
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. “This is embarrassing.”
Shin yawned. “Sorry, but this is boring.”
Ai clenched her fists. “Do you want to fail?!”
Shin smirked. “Ai-chan, if you really wanted to keep me awake, maybe you should give me a better reason to stay focused.”
Ai turned red. “You—”
Kazama sighed. “If you two are done flirting, can we continue?”
Ai instantly straightened. “We’re not flirting!”
Kazama didn’t even look up. “Sure.”
Shin chuckled. “You’re just jealous, Kazama.”
Kazama exhaled sharply. “Shin, I swear—”
Despite the bickering, the study session continued.
For the first time in his life, Shin was studying properly. Not just because he had to—but because he wanted to.
And if it meant spending more time with Ai and Kazama while messing with them?
That was just a bonus.

Chapter 216: The Day of Reckoning
The school hallways felt oddly empty without them.
It was rare for all three—Shin, Ai, and Kazama—to be absent at the same time. Their usual table in the cafeteria remained untouched, a silent reminder that today wasn’t just any day.
Today was the day of the SATs.
And for once, Shin Nohara, the boy who had spent most of his school life avoiding unnecessary effort, was stepping into an exam hall not to wing it, but to actually win it.
Early Morning – Exam Centers
The trio had been assigned to separate exam centers based on their chosen locations, but they had exchanged a few texts before leaving.
[Kazama]: “Remember, guys. Stay calm and pace yourselves.”
 [Ai]: “Don’t make careless mistakes. We’ve prepared for this.”
 [Shin]: “Lol imagine if I fall asleep during the test.”
 [Ai]: “SHIN. I swear—”
Shin chuckled as he pocketed his phone.
Standing outside the exam center, he took a deep breath.
This was it.
For the past few months, Ai and Kazama had drilled study schedules into him, forced him to take practice tests, and made him actually care about his future.
And honestly?
It felt weird.
He never thought he’d be the type to care about exams. But here he was, stepping into the building with a quiet determination.
Shin’s Exam Hall
The room was silent except for the soft rustling of papers and the occasional cough.
Shin sat down, stretching his arms. His pencil rolled across the desk, and he caught it at the last second.
The proctor’s voice rang out. “You may begin.”
Flipping open the first section—math—Shin’s eyes scanned the questions.
He smirked.
“Easy.”
Maybe Ai’s insane study schedule wasn’t completely useless after all.
His pencil moved fluidly across the page. Quadratic equations, data analysis, probability—his mind clicked through them like second nature. He didn’t even realize how much he had improved until now.
For once, he wasn’t just coasting through life.
He was pushing forward.
Ai’s Exam Hall
Ai had barely slept the night before, running through last-minute reviews in her head. But now, as she flipped open her test booklet, a sense of calm washed over her.
This was her arena.
The questions weren’t just numbers and words—they were challenges, puzzles to solve. And Ai loved a good challenge.
She moved efficiently, solving problems with precision, her focus unshakable.
Still, in the back of her mind, she hoped Shin wasn’t screwing around.
And she really hoped he wasn’t sleeping through the test.
Kazama’s Exam Hall
Kazama wasn’t nervous.
Because nerves were for people who weren’t prepared. And Kazama had been preparing for this moment his entire life.
He breezed through the reading section, his analytical skills slicing through the passages like a katana.
This was just another step toward his goal.
Still…
He found himself wondering—how were Shin and Ai doing?
Kazama had never doubted Ai’s capabilities. But Shin…?
Shin had always been unpredictable.
Yet, over the past few months, Kazama had seen something in him. A change.
Maybe, just maybe, Shin wasn’t going to let them down.
Break Time – A Moment of Reflection
Shin leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling during the short break between sections.
He had expected this test to be a nightmare.
Instead, it felt… manageable.
He took a sip of water, staring at the clock.
If he really pulled this off…
If he actually got into a top university abroad with Ai and Kazama…
His whole life would change.
And somehow, for the first time in a long time, that didn’t scare him.
It excited him.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 217: The Results Are In
The anticipation was killing them.
It had been weeks since the SATs, and now, the results were finally out.
Ai sat in the classroom, drumming her fingers against the desk. Kazama looked composed as always, but even he couldn't stop checking his phone every few minutes.
Shin?
Well, Shin was lying back in his chair, spinning a pencil between his fingers, completely unbothered.
"Why do you look so relaxed?" Ai asked, narrowing her eyes. "This is important, Shin. We put in months of effort—"
"Months of your effort," Shin corrected with a lazy grin. "I just kinda... existed through it."
Kazama sighed. "That is exactly why we need to see your results. If you score anything less than top marks, I'm going to—"
Before he could finish, a ping sounded from their phones.
The results were in.
Ai’s Score
Ai took a deep breath and opened her results.
1560.
A sharp exhale left her lips.
"Tch. Not perfect," she muttered, crossing her arms.
Kazama glanced over. "What did you get?"
"1560," she admitted. "It’s good. But I made two mistakes on the reading section."
Kazama nodded approvingly. "Still, that’s an outstanding score."
Ai sighed. "I guess. But if I had just double-checked those two questions—"
"Oi, you’re acting like you failed," Shin chuckled. "That’s basically a perfect score, Ai. Chill a little."
"You don’t get to tell me to chill until I see your score," Ai shot back.
Kazama’s Score
Kazama opened his results next.
1580.
Ai leaned over to peek at his phone. "Hah. So even you didn’t get a perfect score."
Kazama clicked his tongue. "One mistake in the math section."
Ai smirked. "Looks like someone isn’t flawless after all."
Kazama sighed. "Unlike you, I’m not about to start complaining. 1580 is still enough to get into any university."
Ai rolled her eyes. "I know. It’s just—urgh, I wanted that perfect score."
Then, both of them turned toward Shin.
"...What?" Shin blinked at their stares.
Ai crossed her arms. "Your turn."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "Yes, let’s see how much of our studying actually helped you."
Shin shrugged. "Sure, sure." He lazily pulled out his phone, tapped the screen a few times, and—
Paused.
"...Oh," he muttered.
Ai leaned in. "What? What is it?"
Shin scratched the back of his head.
"Uh… I think I might’ve scored perfect."
There was silence.
Then—
"WHAT?"
Ai snatched the phone from his hand.
Kazama practically loomed over them, eyes scanning the screen.
1600.
A perfect score.
No mistakes.
None.
Ai’s jaw dropped. "You— you got a perfect score!?"
Kazama adjusted his glasses again, almost in disbelief. "You didn't just get a perfect score... You did it without trying."
Shin shrugged. "Eh, I kinda tried this time. Y'know, since you guys were watching."
Ai’s eye twitched. "Since we were watching— SHIN, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD WE STUDIED FOR THIS!?"
Shin grinned. "Yup."
"Then how did you—!?"
Shin leaned back in his chair, stretching. "What can I say? I'm built different."
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. "Unbelievable."
Ai groaned. "You infuriate me."
Shin only smirked. "C’mon, Ai, you’re just mad I beat you."
Ai inhaled sharply. "Oh, you are so lucky we’re in a classroom right now—"
Kazama sighed, looking at Shin’s score again. "Perfect. And yet… you still act like it’s nothing."
Shin rolled his eyes. "Look, it’s not nothing. I just don’t make a big deal out of it like you guys."
Kazama stared at him for a long moment.
Then, with a small sigh, he smirked.
"Well… congratulations, Shin."
Ai grumbled under her breath. "Yeah, yeah. Congrats, genius."
Shin grinned. "Aw, thanks, guys. I’ll be expecting my ‘smartest person alive’ trophy in the mail."
Ai threw a notebook at his face.
Shin dodged effortlessly, still laughing.

Chapter 218: The Next Step & The Return of the Kasukabe Defence Team
The trio sat together in the student council room, their laptops open, lists sprawled across the table.
"We need to narrow it down," Kazama muttered, scanning through the universities they had shortlisted. "We’ve got way too many options."
Ai nodded. "Agreed. We should focus on the universities that offer exactly what we’re looking for."
The Shortlist:
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – USA


Shin's choice (Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering)


Kazama's choice (Economics & Business)


Stanford University – USA


Ai's choice (Business, Economics, & Finance)


Shin’s backup choice (Applied Physics & AI Research)


Kazama’s backup choice (Entrepreneurship & Management)


University of Cambridge – UK


Shin’s choice (Natural Sciences with Physics & Mathematics)


Ai’s choice (Economics & Finance)


Kazama’s backup choice (Political Economy)


ETH Zurich – Switzerland


Shin’s choice (Theoretical Physics & Applied Mathematics)


Harvard University – USA


Ai’s choice (MBA, Business Leadership)


University of Tokyo – Japan


Kazama’s choice (Political Science & Economics)


Ai’s backup choice (International Relations & Business)


Caltech – USA


Shin’s choice (Pure Mathematics & Quantum Mechanics)


They went through the list carefully, making sure their choices aligned with their academic interests and future plans.
"We’ll need to start sending in applications soon," Kazama noted. "Our grades are strong, but top universities want more than just scores."
Ai crossed her arms. "Which brings me to my next point—we need extracurriculars."
Shin blinked. "Extracurriculars? We already have plenty, don’t we?"
Ai sighed. "Yes, but universities want well-rounded students. We need to make sure we stand out. Student council alone will look very impressive—two years of handling school events, finances, management, and student body affairs is huge. Then we have kendo, debate, and archery."
Kazama nodded. "That’s solid. But what else?"
Ai tapped her fingers on the desk. "Community service. Top universities love students who’ve been involved in social work. It shows leadership, responsibility, and a sense of duty."
Kazama nodded in agreement. "That’s true. A strong record in community service could make the difference in admissions."
Shin, who had been quiet up until now, suddenly sat up, his eyes shining with excitement.
"Wait." He pointed dramatically. "Are you saying… we need to protect the people? Help the helpless? Defend the defenseless?"
Ai frowned. "Shin, I don’t think—"
Shin slammed his fist on the table. "IT'S TIME FOR THE KASUKABE DEFENSE TEAM TO REFORM!"
There was a long silence.
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. "Oh no."
Ai sighed. "Oh no."
Shin, however, was already on fire.
"We shall rise once again! The children of Kasukabe shall call our names in times of crisis! The weak shall rejoice! The villains shall tremble!" He pointed to the ceiling. "And the universities will BEG to have us!"
Ai rubbed her temples. "This was not what I meant—"
Shin ignored her, whipping out his phone. "I have some calls to make."
A Dramatic Weekend Reunion
The next Saturday, at an abandoned park near their old elementary school, a storm was brewing.
Dark clouds loomed overhead. The wind howled. The camera (if this were a movie) would slowly pan across the scene, showing shadowy figures approaching from different directions.
From one alleyway—Masao, now taller and slightly more confident than before.
From another street—Bo, his silent but strong presence making him look like a warrior returning from exile.
From the park entrance—Nene, flipping her hair with an aura of authority, as if she had come straight from a high-level meeting.
And in the center of it all, standing like a commander about to give a war speech—Shinnosuke Nohara.
The camera zooms in on his face as he smirks.
"Welcome back, my comrades."
Masao adjusted his glasses. "It’s been too long."
Bo nodded silently.
Nene crossed her arms. "So. What’s the mission?"
Shin took a deep breath, his voice dramatic and powerful.
"Kasukabe needs us once more. But this time… our battle is greater than ever before."
Kazama, standing in the background, sighed. "This is so unnecessary."
Ai groaned. "This is why I should never suggest anything to you."
But Shin ignored them, his eyes burning with determination.
"FOR KASUKABE!"
"FOR KASUKABE!" the others chanted in unison.
The Kasukabe Defense Team had returned.

Chapter 219: A Mission Worthy of the Kasukabe Defense Team
The Kasukabe Defense Team stood in a dramatic huddle, eyes burning with determination. The reunion had been grand, the speech inspiring—now came the most difficult part.
"...So," Kazama adjusted his glasses. "What exactly are we doing?"
A heavy silence fell upon the group.
Shin crossed his arms. "Isn't it obvious? We do what we always did—we protect the people!"
Nene deadpanned. "From what?"
Shin frowned. "Uh… from evil?"
Masao tilted his head. "But… there's no evil?"
Shin gasped. "Masao, my dear friend, evil is always lurking! Waiting for us to let our guard down!"
Kazama sighed. "We need something practical, something we can actually put on the university applications."
Shin snapped his fingers. "A-ha! Then let’s play house!"
Silence.
Absolute silence.
A faint breeze passed through the park.
Then, Masao shuddered. Bo’s lips twitched. Kazama adjusted his collar uncomfortably. Ai watched in mild horror as Nene physically recoiled.
"We are never doing that again," Nene hissed.
"Agreed," Masao said quickly.
Shin pouted. "You guys hold onto trauma way too much."
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. "Let’s just go out into town and see where we can actually help, before Shin makes us do something ridiculous."
With that, the Kasukabe Defense Team set out on a mission—this time, one that would actually make a difference.

A Walk Down Memory Lane
They roamed around Kasukabe, searching for places they could volunteer. Along the way, memories of their childhood crept up.
"Remember when we used to run around these streets without a care in the world?" Masao said nostalgically.
"And cause absolute chaos?" Kazama muttered.
Shin smirked. "Good times."
Eventually, they reached a very familiar place. A building that once housed their glorious past.
Their kindergarten.
The Futaba Kindergarten.
For a moment, they just stood there, staring at the place that had witnessed their first friendships, their wildest adventures, and their many, many questionable decisions.
Bo smiled faintly.
"Should we… go in?" Masao asked hesitantly.
"Of course!" Shin declared. "This place raised us! And besides, maybe they could use some help!"
With that, they stepped inside, where a rush of nostalgia hit them like a truck.
And then—
"Huh?! Nohara?!"
A familiar voice echoed through the halls.
They turned to see a woman with wavy brown hair, her expression flipping between shock and amusement.
Midori Yoshinaga.
And beside her, another teacher—Nanako Matsuzaka, who raised an eyebrow at the sight of them.
"What in the world are you kids doing here?" Matsuzaka asked, crossing her arms.
Shin grinned. "We’re here to give back to the place that nurtured us!"
Yoshinaga blinked. "…That sounds suspicious."
Kazama quickly stepped in before Shin could ruin their credibility. "We’re looking for community service opportunities for university applications. We thought our old kindergarten might need extra hands."
Yoshinaga’s face brightened. "Oh! Well, actually, we could use some help…"
Matsuzaka smirked. "Though, knowing you all, should I be worried about letting you near small children?"
Nene scoffed. "We’ve matured!"
Shin winked. "We are model students now."
Matsuzaka gave them a long look. "Uh-huh. Sure."
Then, a voice boomed from the hallway—
"WHAT'S THIS? TROUBLEMAKERS RETURNING TO THE SCENE OF THEIR CRIMES?!"
The group froze.
That voice…
That deep, intimidating voice…
They turned their heads slowly, their childhood instincts screaming at them to run.
Principal Bunta Takakura.
Or as Shin had always called him—THE GANG LEADER.
Despite being an incredibly kind and soft-hearted man, his appearance alone was enough to strike fear into even the most hardened criminals. The large frame, the sharp gaze, the deep voice—he looked exactly like a yakuza boss.
Shin immediately saluted. "Boss! I swear we have reformed!"
Takakura sighed. "You haven’t changed a bit."
Ai stepped forward. "Principal, we were wondering if we could volunteer here. Help with the kids, clean up, anything really."
Takakura stroked his chin. "Hmm. Well, we do have a lot of energetic kids running around. You did survive this kindergarten, so I suppose you’re qualified to handle them."
Shin puffed his chest. "We shall raise them with honor!"
Takakura ignored him and turned to the others. "If you all are serious, we could use the help."
Masao nodded. "We’re serious."
Takakura smiled, his scary features softening. "Then welcome back, kids."

More Opportunities Await
Over the next few days, the group helped at the kindergarten—playing with the children, organizing books, helping set up activities. The teachers were shocked at how responsible they had become.
Shin, however, found himself surrounded by kids who insisted on copying his antics.
"Shinnosuke-senpai! Show us the butt dance!"
"Shin-senpai, how do we impress girls?!"
"Shin-senpai! Teach us your ways!"
Ai sighed. "This was a mistake."
Kazama physically dragged Shin away from the children before he could corrupt them further.
Through their work, the teachers and Principal Takakura introduced them to more community service opportunities—volunteering at the library, cleaning up local parks, and even participating in events for elderly residents in the town.
Little by little, their Kasukabe Defense Team was actually making a difference.
Kazama adjusted his glasses, watching as Shin helped a little kid learn how to tie his shoes.
"You know… this actually feels kind of nice," he admitted.
Ai smiled. "See? Community service isn’t a waste of time."
Shin patted the kid on the head. "Of course! After all, the Kasukabe Defense Team shall forever be the shield of justice!"
Masao groaned. "Please don’t make this weird."
As the sun set on their old kindergarten, their childhood long behind them, the Kasukabe Defense Team found themselves looking ahead.
Not just to university.
Not just to their future careers.
But to the kind of people they were growing into.
And with that, their next step was clear.
(TO BE CONTINUED IN CHAPTER 220.)

Chapter 220: Silence Between Friends
The Kasukabe Defense Team was no stranger to conflict. They bickered, argued, and got on each other’s nerves all the time. But at the end of the day, everything usually went back to normal.
That’s why when Masao and Nene had one of their usual squabbles, no one thought much of it—until something changed.
This time, Masao didn’t just get flustered or whine about it.
He got mad.
And for the first time, instead of snapping back, he just… stopped talking to Nene.
And that silence stretched on longer than anyone expected.

The Incident
It happened after school one day, when the group was hanging out in their usual spot. The conversation had started lighthearted, something about an upcoming event at school.
Then, Nene had said something.
Something that, if worded differently, might have just been another teasing jab.
But it wasn’t worded differently.
"No wonder you never had a girlfriend, Masao."
She had meant it to be a casual remark, the kind she always threw at him. It wasn’t even meant to be cruel—just the usual teasing.
But it hit differently this time.
Masao’s smile faded. His shoulders tensed, and his expression darkened in a way none of them had seen before.
For a second, he looked genuinely hurt.
And then, without saying a word, he just turned and walked away.
The group sat in stunned silence.
Nene blinked. "Huh? What’s up with him?"
Bo looked at her. "…That was kinda harsh."
Shin rubbed the back of his neck. "Yeah, I mean, we roast each other all the time, but you did basically call him a loser."
Nene scoffed. "Oh, come on! It was just a joke."
Ai frowned. "But it clearly got to him."
Kazama sighed. "Masao has always been sensitive about certain things. And you hit a nerve."
For the rest of the day, Masao avoided them. He didn’t reply to messages, didn’t show up for their usual hangout spots. The next morning at school, when Nene greeted him casually, expecting things to go back to normal, Masao just walked past her like she wasn’t there.
The first day of silence was surprising.
The second day was awkward.
The third day was uncomfortable.
By the end of the week, the group was genuinely concerned.
Nene, at first, brushed it off. "He’ll get over it."
But as the days passed, and Masao still didn’t talk to her, still didn’t acknowledge her, something unsettling settled in her stomach.
The longest they had ever gone without talking was maybe a day.
This was too long.
And for the first time, Nene felt something she never thought she’d feel about Masao’s silence.
Regret.

Concern and Reflection
"You really messed up, huh?" Shin commented one afternoon as the group sat together—minus Masao, who had found another seat.
Nene frowned, arms crossed. "I still think he’s overreacting."
Ai sighed. "Do you really believe that?"
Nene didn’t answer.
Kazama tapped his fingers on the table. "Masao’s not the type to hold a grudge, but… I think this time, it really got to him."
Bo, who had been silent this whole time, finally spoke.
"Masao has always been worried about that, you know."
Nene looked at him. "What?"
Bo turned his gaze toward Masao, who was sitting a few tables away, eating alone.
"He always thought no one would see him as someone worth dating. That he was just the comic relief, the weak one, the scaredy-cat. Even if he laughed with us, he always worried that no girl would take him seriously."
Nene swallowed.
Bo continued, "And you, the person who has known him the longest, basically confirmed that fear."
The words settled deep into her chest.
She had always teased Masao, but she had never meant anything by it. She thought it was just their dynamic.
But had she actually hurt him all this time without realizing it?
Had she actually made him believe that no one—especially her—would ever see him as more than a joke?
For the first time, she started to understand why this time was different.
And why it wasn’t going to fix itself unless she did something about it.

To be continued in Chapter 221.

the grp decided not to interven as it was something nene had to sort out herself, she tried everything in the book but it didnt work, this lasted for 3 more days till one evening as masao didnt reponded to her calling him, she snapped, but this time it was different, she wept angrily at him apologising to him but still throwing the usual jabs, and how masao is a meany for doing this to her, but also how she is extremelty sorry and scared that masao will never see her again. but as she wept and ranted she blurted out her most hidden serecte about him.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 221: Breaking Point
The group had made their decision.
This was Nene’s problem to solve.
No one was going to interfere. No nudges from Shin, no quiet encouragement from Ai, no subtle setups from Kazama. Not even Bo, despite his calm understanding of the situation.
Nene had to fix this herself.
She tried everything in the book.
She greeted him brightly in the morning, acting as if nothing had happened. Masao ignored her.
She tried guilt-tripping him—"Are you really gonna be mad forever? Over a little joke?" Masao still ignored her.
She even bought him melon bread, something he usually would’ve caved for in an instant. He accepted it—but still didn’t say a word to her.
Nothing worked.
Three more days passed.
By this point, even the group—who had sworn not to interfere—felt the suffocating tension.
Masao didn’t look angry anymore. He just looked… indifferent.
And for Nene, that was even worse.

The Breaking Point
It was a quiet evening, and the sky was burning orange with the sunset.
Nene spotted Masao walking ahead of her on the way home.
She hesitated for only a second before calling out.
"Masao!"
No response.
"Masao, wait up!"
He kept walking.
And something inside Nene snapped.
"MASAO!"
She ran forward, grabbed his arm, and forced him to turn toward her.
His face was unreadable, his usual nervous expression completely absent. The boy who always flailed and fumbled when she so much as teased him now looked at her with nothing but quiet patience.
Like he was waiting.
And Nene hated that.
Her fists clenched. "You’re such a meanie, Masao!"
Masao blinked.
"You won’t talk to me no matter what I do, and—and I get it, okay?!" She stomped her foot, her voice breaking with frustration. "I said something stupid! I hurt you! But I didn’t mean to, and you know that!"
She was yelling.
But then her voice cracked, and suddenly, her vision blurred.
Tears slipped down her cheeks.
Masao’s eyes widened.
"You’re such an idiot!" Nene sobbed angrily. "*I don’t know what else to do! I’ve tried everything, and you just—you just keep ignoring me!"
Masao finally parted his lips. "Nene—"
"No!" She wiped her eyes furiously, glaring at him through her tears. "You don’t get to say anything yet! I’m still mad!"
Masao stayed silent, watching as she ranted and cried at the same time.
"You’re supposed to be the dumb, cowardly Masao!" she sniffled. "The one who panics when I tease him, the one who always needs saving! But you’re acting so cool and mature, and I don’t like it!"
She hiccupped. "You’re really not gonna talk to me ever again? After all these years?"
Masao shifted uncomfortably.
Nene bit her lip. And then, through her raw emotions, she blurted out something she had never meant to say out loud.
"I always thought if someone was going to like you first, it should be me!"
Silence.
Nene’s breath hitched.
Masao froze.
The weight of her own words crashed down on her, but it was too late.
She had said it.
Her most hidden secret.
Something she had never admitted, not even to herself.
And now Masao knew.
Her heart pounded as she stood there, waiting, vulnerable in a way she had never been before.
Would he ignore her again? Would he laugh? Would he—
Masao exhaled deeply. And then, for the first time in days, he smiled.
A small, quiet, knowing smile.
"…That’s all I needed to hear."
Nene hiccupped. "H-Huh?"
Masao sighed, his shoulders finally relaxing. "You’re an idiot too, you know that?"
Her lip wobbled. "Yeah? Well—so are you!"
He chuckled.
And just like that, the weight between them lifted.
Nene sniffled. "You’re still a meanie."
Masao nodded. "And you’re still the loudest person I know."
A pause.
And then, Masao gently reached out—tentative, unsure—and ruffled her hair.
She blinked, stunned into silence.
He smiled softly. "But thanks for telling me."
For the first time in days, Masao walked home with Nene at his side.
And this time, when she talked…
He listened.

Chapter 222: Too Smooth to Be Normal
The moment Nene and Masao walked into school the next morning, side by side, chatting.
The group knew something was off.
Like, really off.
There was no awkward tension, no lingering hostility, no half-hearted jabs with hidden irritation.
Instead, Masao looked… relaxed.
And Nene?
She wasn’t just talking to him—she was actually listening when he spoke.
Kazama adjusted his glasses (even though he didn't wear any). "Did they—"
"Yeah," Shin answered before Kazama even finished.
Ai, standing beside them, observed the scene carefully. "This isn’t just a resolution," she murmured. "Something big happened."
"Too big," Bo added in his usual calm but knowing tone.
The group exchanged glances.
And just like that, an unspoken decision was made.
They were splitting up.
The boys would investigate Masao.
The girls would handle Nene.
And they would get to the bottom of this.

Interrogation No. 1: Masao
"Alright, spill it."
Masao barely had time to sit down for lunch before Shin and Kazama flanked him on either side, with Bo quietly staring at him from across the table.
Masao blinked. "W-What?"
Shin leaned in, eyes sharp. "You and Nene. What happened?"
"What do you mean?" Masao took a careful bite of his food, feigning ignorance. "She apologized, and I forgave her. That’s all.*"
"Liar." Kazama crossed his arms. "This isn’t how grudges resolve. There should at least be lingering awkwardness."
"Yeah!" Shin pointed dramatically. "Where’s the usual ‘Nene tries to fix things but makes them worse’ stage? Or the ‘Masao is still annoyed but is slowly warming up’ phase? You guys skipped all the necessary progression!"
Masao gave them a flat look. "You guys make my life sound like a badly written drama."
Bo, still silent, merely tilted his head. "You confessed, didn’t you?"
Masao froze.
Shin and Kazama’s eyes widened.
Kazama adjusted his non-existent glasses again. "Oh?"
"Oh-ho?!" Shin smirked, leaning even closer. "You did confess, didn’t you?"
Masao hesitated.
Then, very quietly, he muttered, "…She confessed first."
The boys all froze.
Then—
"…Pfftt—!"
Shin cackled.
Kazama sighed, shaking his head. "This actually explains a lot."
Bo just gave a satisfied nod.
Masao groaned, covering his face. "I knew you guys would be annoying about this."
"Hey, hey, no shame, man." Shin clapped him on the back. "*I’m just impressed Nene cracked first.**"
Kazama smirked. "So? What did you say back?"
Masao hesitated again.
Then, quietly, with a rare look of confidence, he muttered:
"I told her that was all I needed to hear."
A pause.
Then Shin fell over laughing.
"YOU SMOOTH IDIOT!"
Kazama let out a short chuckle, Bo simply smiled.
And Masao?
He just shook his head, grinning.

Interrogation No. 2: Nene
Meanwhile, in another part of the school, Ai and Hima were staring at Nene like she was the last puzzle piece they needed.
"What’s with you guys?" Nene asked, raising an eyebrow.
"Oh, nothing," Ai hummed, smiling. "We’re just here to… casually ask about your sudden peace treaty with Masao."
"Yeah!" Hima nodded eagerly. "You were fighting for days, and now you're suddenly fine?"
Nene shrugged, biting into her melon bread. "I apologized. He forgave me. End of story."
"Liar." Ai’s eyes gleamed. "You don’t get this level of peace without something big happening."
Nene huffed. "Tch. You guys are nosy."
"We’re your best friends," Ai corrected, resting her chin on her hand. "And best friends don’t let major life-changing events slide without a full debriefing."
Nene groaned. "Ugh, fine."
And just like that—she spilled everything.

Flashback: The Night It Happened
As their paths split at the end of their walk, Masao stopped.
"Nene."
She turned. "Yeah?"
He hesitated for only a second before meeting her gaze directly.
And then, with a soft but determined voice, he said—
"I like you too."
Nene’s breath caught.
Masao smiled slightly. "I think I always have."
Her eyes widened.
Her cheeks burned.
Her entire world tilted slightly.
And for the first time in her entire life…
Nene couldn’t find a single snarky remark.
Masao chuckled at her stunned silence. "Wow. This might be the first time you’ve ever been speechless."
That snapped her out of it.
"Sh-Shut up!" She smacked his arm, but the hit was weak, her face still burning. "Don’t ruin the moment!"
Masao just grinned. "I wasn’t planning to."
Nene bit her lip. "So… now what?"
Masao exhaled, his expression soft. "Now?" He smiled. "Now, we see what happens next."
Nene stared at him.
And then, despite everything—despite the fight, the tears, the years of bickering and teasing—
She smiled too.

Back to Present
Ai and Hima sat there, stunned.
Nene huffed. "Well? Say something!"
Ai was the first to recover. She grinned. "Oh, we’re so going to celebrate this later."
Hima, still wide-eyed, slowly nodded. "You guys are actually dating now?"
Nene’s cheeks turned pink. "W-Well, not officially, but—" She crossed her arms. "We’re something."
Ai smirked. "Oh, you’re definitely something alright."
Hima giggled. "I can’t believe it. Nene and Masao? This is a plot twist!"
Nene groaned, covering her face. "Ugh, I regret telling you guys already."
Ai simply patted her back. "Too late, darling. This information is ours now."*

Epilogue: Mission Success
The groups reconvened at the end of lunch.
The boys and girls exchanged looks.
And with unspoken understanding, they nodded to each other.
Mission complete.
Now, they just had to see how this played out from here.

To be continued in Chapter 223.

the next chapter 223, starts with shin and ai standing in a church, with wedding dress, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN. ( flash back: ai grand ma came over to ai's house when shin was over, the ususal process happen when someone first meets shin, then after a while the grand ma said melodramtically that she didnt know how much time will she have in this life so she wanted to see the 2 get married. so the grp decide to do a fake wedding obviously.)
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 223: Wait, WHAT?!
The grand doors of the church creaked open, revealing an extravagant interior bathed in golden light. A long red carpet stretched toward the altar, where two figures stood side by side.
Ai.
Dressed in a dazzling white wedding gown, a delicate veil draped over her hair, her expression unreadable.
And next to her—
Shinchan.
Wearing a fitted white suit, a slight smirk on his face as he whispered, "How did we even get here?"
Ai sighed. "I was about to ask the same thing."
The priest cleared his throat. "Shall we begin?"
Shin leaned slightly toward Ai. "You think if we run now, we can make it?"
Ai smiled sweetly. "No. Because I will personally drag you back here."
Shin sighed dramatically. "Welp. Might as well roll with it."*

Flashback: One Week Earlier
It all started innocently enough.
Shin was over at Ai’s house, lounging comfortably on the couch, casually stealing snacks from the table as Ai worked on her laptop.
Everything was normal.
Until—
"AI-CHAN! MY DEAR AI-CHAN!!"
A powerful voice boomed through the house.
Ai flinched. "Oh no…"
Shin blinked. "Who the heck—"
Before he could finish, the doors BURST open, revealing—
An elderly woman.
Dressed in an elegant kimono, a regal aura surrounding her, eyes sharp enough to pierce through steel—
Ai’s grandmother.
And the moment her sharp gaze landed on Shin, the entire room tensed.
Shinchan—normally unfazed by anything—felt a shiver run down his spine.
The woman stared at him.
Then, slowly, she turned to Ai.
"Who. Is. This. BOY?"
Ai sighed. "Grandma, this is Shinchan."*
Silence.
Then—
"AI-CHAN, HAVE YOU FINALLY BROUGHT HOME A MAN?!"
Ai choked on air. "GRANDMA NO—"
Shin barely held back a laugh. "Damn, straight to the point, huh?"
The grandmother examined him, circling around like a predator eyeing its prey.
Shin stood still, arms crossed, utterly unbothered.
Ai, however, was sweating.
"Hmph.**" The grandmother narrowed her eyes. "You look like trouble."
Shin grinned. "That’s what everyone says."*
Ai groaned. "You're NOT helping."*
Then—suddenly—
The grandmother let out a melodramatic sigh.
"I do not know… how much time I have left in this life…"
Ai tensed. "Oh no."*
"Before I depart from this world…" The old woman dabbed her eyes dramatically. "I wish to see my beloved granddaughter married."*
Shin and Ai froze.
"Wait, what?" Shin blinked. "Are you dying?!"
"Of course not!" The grandmother scoffed. "But I could! At any moment! And I do not want to leave this world without witnessing Ai-chan in a wedding dress!"*
Ai massaged her temples. "Grandma, you are seventy-eight! You're healthier than I am!"
"That is NOT the point!"*
The grandmother dramatically grasped Ai's hands. "Please, my dear! Just once! Let me see a wedding!"*
Ai groaned. "You mean my wedding."*
"Exactly!"*
Shin, who had been enjoying the drama, casually leaned back. "Well, that escalated quickly."*
Ai turned to him. "DON’T ENCOURAGE HER."*
"I didn’t say anything."*
Her grandmother clasped her hands together, eyes sparkling. "Ai-chan… just one wedding… for me…"
Ai sighed. "I cannot believe I’m saying this but—"
She turned to Shin.
"Wanna do a fake wedding?"
Shin smirked. "Hell yeah."*

Back to Present: The Wedding
Shin and Ai stood at the altar, the priest clearing his throat again.
The entire group was there.
Kazama sat in the front row, arms crossed, shaking his head. "I can’t believe this is actually happening."*
Hima was taking pictures like this was the event of the year. "THIS IS AMAZING."*
Bo, as usual, remained silent but gave a small approving nod.
Masao and Nene?
They were whispering way too much.
"So, like… do they have to kiss at the end?" Masao muttered.
Nene grinned. "Ohhh, I hope so."*
Ai, hearing them, turned her head slightly. "I CAN HEAR YOU, YOU IDIOTS."*
Masao shrugged. "Just saying!"*
"Let us proceed!" The priest continued, completely ignoring the chaos. "Do you, Ai-chan, take this man—"
Ai sighed. "I guess."*
"And do you, Shin-chan, take this woman—"
"Might as well."*
The priest blinked. "Uh… that’s not very romantic—"
"JUST CONTINUE."*
The priest cleared his throat. "Very well. Then, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you—"
Suddenly—
"WAIT!!"
Everyone turned.
It was Ai’s grandma.
She stood up, tears in her eyes, holding out a small velvet box.
"The RINGS! You forgot the RINGS!"*
Ai facepalmed. "Grandma, it’s fake!"
"That does NOT mean we skip important steps!"*
Shin laughed. "You know what? Sure. Let’s go all out."*
The grandma happily handed them two real rings.
Ai groaned. "Oh my god, why do you have these?"
"Just in case!"*
Ai sighed before slipping the ring onto Shin’s finger. "Fine. There. Happy?"
Shin, with a smug grin, took her hand and slid the other ring onto her finger.
"There. Now we're fake married."*
The grandma wept tears of joy.
"IT'S BEAUTIFUL!!"
Kazama sighed. "I don’t know whether to be impressed or horrified."*
Masao nudged Nene. "They still have to kiss, right?"
Nene nodded. "Oh yeah, it’s the rule."*
Ai turned toward Shin. "Don't even think about it."*
Shin smirked. "Too late, I already thought about it."*
Ai glared. "Shin."*
Shin just laughed. "Relax, I know better than to get murdered today."*
The priest chuckled. "Well, I suppose this concludes the—"
BOOM!
The doors BURST open.
A furious-looking Hiroshi and Misae stood at the entrance.
"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?!"
Ai froze. "Oh, shi—"
Shin grinned. "Oh, this just got WAY more fun."*

Got it! The fake wedding will gradually spiral out of control, with more and more people getting involved—family, friends, even school faculty—until it feels too real, even for Shinchan. He’ll start treating it like a bizarre fever dream, adding to the hilarity. Meanwhile, the whole thing is kept a secret from everyone except the main group, who struggle to maintain the illusion.

Got it! So Ai's grandma and some guests actually believe it's real, while everyone else (Shin, Ai, their friends, and most of the family) are in on the fact that it’s fake. This creates a hilarious situation where they have to act convincingly while struggling to keep up the act.
I’ll make sure Shin’s reaction is especially funny—going from confusion to reluctant acceptance as things spiral out of control. The contrast between the ridiculousness of the situation and the seriousness of some participants (especially Ai’s grandma) will make for a perfect Shinchan-style chaotic comedy.

Chapter 223: A Wedding That Shouldn't Be
Shin stared ahead, his mind blank. He was standing inside a grand church, wearing a sharp black tuxedo, his hair slightly neater than usual (courtesy of his mother’s forceful combing). Next to him, Ai stood in a breathtaking white wedding dress, a soft veil over her face, holding a bouquet of white roses. The massive stained-glass windows illuminated the space, casting colorful patterns onto the marble floors.
A priest stood before them, flipping through a book.
Family and friends filled the pews, some grinning, some teary-eyed, and some looking as baffled as Shin felt.
How did this happen?
—
[Flashback: A Few Days Ago]
Ai’s grandmother had arrived for a long-overdue visit, dressed in an elegant kimono, carrying herself with the grace of an empress. Shin had been over at Ai’s house when the usual first-meeting ritual took place:
The old lady had sized him up.


She had immediately found him lacking.


He had somehow won her over in record time with his absurd antics.


But then, after a few days, she dropped a bombshell at the dinner table.
"I don’t know how much time I have left in this life… I only have one wish before I leave this world: to see Ai happily married."
Silence.
Ai coughed mid-sip of tea. Her mother choked on rice. Renji, her father, nearly dropped his sake cup.
Shin? Shin was still stuck processing the words.
Then, her grandmother dramatically clutched Ai’s hands. "And since I’ve already seen what a wonderful young man you have, why wait? You two should get married now!"
Shin almost spat out his drink.
—
[Two Days Later]
It started as a ridiculous idea—a fake wedding, just to make Ai’s grandmother happy. Everyone who was in on it agreed it was a harmless little play.
But the plan went off the rails.
Her grandmother insisted on sending out invitations. And due to some minor communication failures, not all the guests were informed that the wedding was fake.
Relatives from overseas RSVP’d. Ai’s mother got too into the planning. Renji shed a single tear of pride at the thought of his daughter’s wedding.
And then Shin’s parents got involved.
At some point, the event spiraled so far out of control that Shin decided to accept it as some sort of lucid dream.
—
[Present: The "Wedding" Begins]
The church doors swung open. The sound of an organ filled the air.
Ai walked down the aisle, guided by her father, who looked like he was about to break down in tears.
Shin stood at the altar, barely holding in a maniacal urge to laugh.
He glanced around the room.
Kazama, Nene, Bo, and Masao were all seated in the front row, watching like they were witnessing a once-in-a-lifetime event. Kazama was facepalming. Bo looked thoughtful. Masao had the expression of a man watching a car crash.
In the back rows, some of Ai’s distant relatives—who weren’t informed—were already whispering excitedly about the marriage of the century.
The priest cleared his throat. "We are gathered here today to witness the union of these two souls—"
"Is this actually happening?!" Shin’s brain screamed.
He felt Ai’s hand slip into his. He turned to her, expecting her to be flustered, but instead, she had the most mischievous smile on her face.
"Shin," she whispered. "Are you nervous?"
Shin smirked. "Nah. I’m just waiting for the plot twist."

Chapter 224: Wedding of the Century (Total Disaster Edition)
Shin mentally braced himself as the priest continued his speech.
"We are gathered here today to witness the union of these two souls—"
Shin stole a glance at Ai. She was barely holding in her laughter, her hand still in his. This was insane. This was beyond insane.
But the worst part? Some people actually thought it was real.
He turned his gaze to the crowd.
Ai’s grandmother was wiping her eyes dramatically, whispering about how she could now die in peace.


Kazama looked like he was calculating the exact moment this would all explode.


Nene had her phone out, recording every moment for future blackmail.


Bo was just nodding sagely, as if witnessing something profound.


Masao looked two seconds away from passing out.


Meanwhile, Ai’s father, Renji, had taken out a handkerchief, patting his eyes. "My daughter… is really getting married. And to Shin…" He paused, suddenly deep in thought. "…Wait, should I be worried?"
Before he could complete that thought, someone in the audience started clapping.
And that was the tipping point.
The Chaos Begins
The crowd took that as a cue, and suddenly the entire church exploded into applause.
Someone started cheering.


Someone else shouted, "They grow up so fast!"


Ai’s mother was dabbing at her tears.


A random uncle raised a glass and yelled, "To a happy life!"


"Oh no," Shin thought. "This is getting out of control."
Then—
"SOMEONE STOP THE WEDDING!"
Everyone turned.
Standing at the entrance, Misae, Shin’s mother, looked like she had run a marathon to get here. She was panting, hands on her knees, trying to catch her breath. Then she straightened up, pointing an accusatory finger at Ai.
"AI-CHAN!" she shouted. "DID YOU TRICK MY SON INTO MARRYING YOU?!"
Ai, in true dramatic fashion, gasped. "Okaa-san, how could you say that?! This is true love!"
Shin choked on his own breath.
"AI, DON'T MAKE THIS WORSE!"
Misae’s eye twitched. "Then explain why I only found out about this today?! You didn’t even invite us properly! I had to hear it from a NEIGHBOR!"
From the crowd, Hiroshi (Shin’s father) raised a hand sheepishly. "I actually knew…"
Misae snapped her head toward him. "YOU KNEW AND DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING?!"
Hiroshi scratched his head. "I just wanted to see what would happen."
Shin paled. "MY OWN FATHER SOLD ME OUT FOR ENTERTAINMENT?!"
Meanwhile, Ai’s grandmother turned to Ai’s father. "Renji! I thought you were handling this properly! How dare you not invite Misae-san properly?!"
Renji, who was still emotional, blinked. "Wait. What do you mean, ‘properly’?"
Then it hit him.
"Wait… does my own mother-in-law think this is real?!"
At this moment, Kazama, Nene, Bo, and Masao decided to quietly get up and exit the church.
They had seen enough.
Shin’s Desperate Escape Plan
Shin leaned into Ai’s ear. "Ai… if we run now, we might make it out alive."
Ai grinned. "But Shin, don’t you want to hear the vows?"
"The what?"
The priest smiled. "Ah, yes, the vows!"
Shin’s soul left his body.
Ai turned to him with a devious smile. "Shin, do you promise to always be by my side, love me forever, and never abandon me?"
Shin took a slow, deep breath.
Then he grabbed Ai’s hand and turned to the audience.
"EVERYONE, I’M SORRY TO ANNOUNCE—"
CRASH!
Before he could finish, the church doors BURST OPEN AGAIN.
Everyone turned to see—
Hima, panting and out of breath.
"SHIN-NIISAN, I JUST HEARD—"
She froze. Stared at the altar. Stared at the guests.
Then, in a horrified whisper—
"WHAT THE HELL DID I MISS?!"
Shin sighed.
"I give up."

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 225: A Wedding to Remember (Total Disaster Continues Edition)
At this point, Shin had completely given up on understanding reality.
He had somehow ended up in a wedding, in a suit, standing in front of a priest, with Ai—wearing a beautiful white dress—smiling at him like she had planned this from birth.
His mom had stormed the church. His dad was just enjoying the show. His sister had barged in, horrified. The entire school council was watching. And the random guests who weren’t informed this was fake were crying their eyes out.
And now—
"The vows."
Shin felt his brain short-circuit. "I need an escape plan, right now."
Before he could even blink, Ai took a deep breath and started speaking.
The Unexpected Vow
"Shin, I promise to always be by your side, to support you no matter what, and to make sure you never take things too seriously."
Shin froze.
"Wait… what?"
Ai continued, her voice soft but firm. "I promise to love you, to annoy you, and to make you regret ever meeting me—but in the best way possible."
Shin's heart skipped a beat.
He knew this was fake, just for Ai’s grandmother. He knew this was all for fun. But the way Ai was looking at him right now… it felt too real.
Ai took his hands.
"And since I already know you won’t say anything embarrassing in return—"
Before Shin could react—
Ai suddenly pulled him forward—AND KISSED HIM.
SHOCK. ABSOLUTE SHOCK.
Shin.exe has stopped working.
The crowd gasped.


Ai’s grandmother cheered.


Hima screamed.


Misae gained a whole new reason to murder Ai.


Kazama, Nene, Bo, and Masao, who were sneaking out, turned back IMMEDIATELY.


"Did that just happen?" was the collective thought in the room.
After what felt like an eternity, Ai pulled back, grinning.
Shin just stood there.
Stunned.
Not moving.
Not even breathing.
Then—
TOTAL CHAOS.
"AI-CHAN, YOU—!!" Misae was charging toward the altar, ready to throw hands.
Hima was covering her eyes in horror. "MY INNOCENCE—!"
Kazama yelled in disbelief. "DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN?!"
Masao was weeping. "I KNEW IT WOULD BE HER FIRST!"
Bo simply nodded, "Expected."
Ai’s father, Renji, looked at the scene, took a deep breath, and downed an entire glass of whiskey in one go.
And Shin?
Shin was still frozen.
His brain was processing at dial-up speed.
Did she just…
Did she actually…
Before his system could reboot, the priest—bless this man—clapped his hands.
"With that, I now pronounce you—"
"NO! WAIT!" Shin finally regained control of his body.
He turned to the guests, waving his arms frantically. "EVERYONE, WAIT! THIS ISN’T REAL! THIS IS A FAKE WEDDING!"
Silence.
Ai’s grandmother blinked. "Excuse me?"
Shin gulped. "I-It was just to make you happy, Grandma!" He pointed at Ai. "SHE TRICKED ME!"
Ai gasped dramatically, holding her chest. "Shin! How could you accuse your own wife like this?!"
"WE ARE NOT MARRIED!"
Ai pouted. "Tell that to everyone who just saw us kiss."
Shin glitched again.
The damage had already been done.
Aftermath: The Wedding That Wasn’t
After thirty minutes of explaining, arguing, and calming down Shin’s furious mother, the truth finally came out.
The wedding was never official.
But the problem? Ai’s grandmother still thought it was real.
And by the time they finally convinced her otherwise—
She just waved them off. "Well, real or not, you two will get married eventually."
Shin choked on air.
Ai beamed. "You hear that, Shin? It’s fate."
Shin sighed. This woman was going to be the death of him.
But as they stood outside the church, Ai nudged him.
"You mad?" she asked teasingly.
Shin sighed. "I don’t even know anymore."
Ai smiled. "I just wanted to make a fun memory with you."
Shin looked at her.
And despite everything—
Despite the chaos—
Despite how utterly embarrassing this was—
He couldn’t help but smile a little.
"...Yeah. It was definitely memorable."

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 226: A Moment That Wasn’t Fake
The night air was cool as Shin and Ai walked side by side, still dressed in their wedding attire.
The last of the guests had left, the church was empty, and the only thing that remained was the quiet laughter between them as they recounted the absolute disaster of the day.
"I can’t believe your mom almost threw me out of a window," Ai chuckled, her fingers gently brushing against the fabric of her dress as they strolled down the empty church pathway.
"Yeah, well, I can’t believe you actually kissed me in front of a hundred people," Shin muttered, rubbing the back of his neck. "What was that for?"
Ai smirked. "You always act like you don’t care, so I wanted to see if I could get a reaction out of you."
Shin let out a deep sigh. "Congratulations. My entire system crashed. Are you happy?"
Ai giggled. "Very."
They reached the church stage, now empty and quiet. The warm glow of the streetlights outside filtered through the stained-glass windows, painting soft colors across the floor.
Ai turned to Shin. "You know, even though it was fake, it kinda felt real for a moment," she admitted, looking up at the grand ceiling. "Not the legal part, obviously. But standing there, saying vows, looking at you like that… it was nice."
Shin stared at her for a moment, something unreadable in his expression.
Then, without warning, he took her hand and pulled her back up onto the stage.
Ai blinked in surprise. "H-Hey, what are you—?"
Shin stood in front of her, silent for a moment, before letting out a small breath.
Then, in a voice softer than she had ever heard from him, he spoke.
"I want to say mine too."
Ai froze.
Her heart skipped a beat.
For once, Shin was serious. No jokes, no sarcasm, no dodging feelings.
Just him.
Just his raw, unfiltered words.
Shin took a breath, then looked straight into her eyes.
"Ai, I promise I’ll always be honest with you—even when it’s hard."
"I promise to be there for you, even when you don’t ask."
"I promise that no matter what happens, no matter where we end up in life, you’ll always have a place with me."
"And if one day, this kind of moment isn’t fake anymore… I wouldn’t mind."
Ai’s breath hitched.
Her eyes widened.
Her fingers curled around the fabric of her dress.
"Shin…"
Shin gave a small smirk, but this time, it wasn’t his usual teasing one. It was warm, real.
Then, before Ai could even process everything—
Shin stepped forward, cupped her cheek, and kissed her.
This time—
It wasn’t for a joke.
It wasn’t for the guests.
It wasn’t for anyone else.
It was just for them.
For a long, quiet moment, the world melted away.
When they finally pulled apart, Ai could barely breathe.
Shin smirked. "So, did I get a reaction out of you this time?"
Ai blinked, then let out a breathless laugh. "You… you idiot."
But her face was bright red.
And her heart was racing.
Shin chuckled, stepping back, offering his arm like an actual groom. "C’mon, wife. Let’s go home."
Ai rolled her eyes but looped her arm through his anyway.
As they walked out together, hand in hand, one thing was for sure—
Fake or not… this was a moment neither of them would ever forget.

Chapter 227: The Final Step Towards the Future
Just as the whirlwind that was the wedding fiasco settled, reality hit fast and hard.
It was time.
Shin, Ai, and Kazama sat in the student council room after school, their laptops open, finalizing their applications. The weight of their decisions pressed on them now more than ever.
"Alright," Ai exhaled, stretching her arms. "This is it. No more changes. No more edits. Once we hit send, it's out of our hands."
Kazama nodded, adjusting his posture. "I triple-checked everything. My essays, my grades, my extracurriculars… It should be solid."
Shin, on the other hand, looked shockingly casual. He leaned back in his chair, arms crossed behind his head, eyes scanning his laptop screen lazily.
Ai squinted at him. "Shin… you did actually put effort into this, right?"
Shin smirked. "Of course. I even used big words in my essays."
Ai groaned. "Shin!"
Kazama sighed. "At this point, I’m convinced you could write a single sentence for your essay and still get accepted."
Shin shrugged. "What can I say? I’m built different."
Ai rolled her eyes but smiled. "Alright, let's go over it one last time."
—
Universities They Applied To:
Shinnosuke Nohara
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – Mathematics, Physics, and Engineering


University of Tokyo – Physics and Mathematics


Stanford University – Physics and Applied Mathematics


ETH Zurich – Mathematical and Computational Science


Shin had always been a natural at math and science. His decision to pursue a career in academia, research, or even Kendo later gave him the perfect balance of structure and freedom. He especially liked the idea of studying in the U.S. or Europe, where he could do both at his own pace.
Ai Suotome
Harvard University – Business and Economics


Stanford University – International Relations and Finance


London School of Economics (LSE) – Economics and Management


University of Tokyo – Business and International Affairs


Being the heir to a powerful conglomerate, Ai was fully prepared to step into her role. But she wanted to carve her own path, not just inherit what her family had built. Studying abroad would open her opportunities to global markets, and she wanted to be ready.
Toru Kazama
University of Tokyo – Law and International Relations


Columbia University – Law


Stanford University – Law and Business


Cambridge University – International Law


Kazama had always been disciplined and precise. He wanted to change the world, make an impact on policies, and ensure fairness and justice in business and law. His choices reflected his ambition—Tokyo for home stability, Cambridge for prestige, Columbia for opportunities in the U.S., and Stanford to be close to Ai and Shin.
—
With their applications finalized, all that was left was to submit them.
Ai placed her finger on the "Submit" button of her laptop. "Okay, on three?"
Kazama nodded. "One…"
Shin cracked his knuckles. "Two…"
All three of them exchanged a look.
And then—
"Three."
They hit submit.
The weight of months of preparation, years of work, and countless hours of stress disappeared in an instant.
Silence filled the room as the three of them stared at their screens.
Ai exhaled first. "That’s it… We actually did it."
Kazama leaned back, rubbing his temples. "Now we wait. And pray."
Shin stretched his arms and smirked. "Welp, now that that’s done, who wants ramen?"
Ai groaned. "You can’t immediately switch to food!"
Kazama sighed. "He can. And he will."
The three of them laughed.
For now, the hard part was over.
But soon—their futures would be decided.

Chapter 228: The Typhoon Incident
It was supposed to be a simple weekend.
Shin had come over to Ai’s place to hang out, eat some expensive snacks, and laze around in her ridiculously luxurious living room. Her parents were out for a business trip, so it was just the two of them. Nothing unusual.
But as night fell, things took an unexpected turn.
Shin was casually putting on his shoes at the entrance when his phone buzzed with an emergency alert. Ai’s phone chimed at the same time.
⚠️ Typhoon Warning Issued! Stay indoors. Avoid unnecessary travel. Heavy winds and rainfall expected. ⚠️
Shin glanced outside. The rain had already started to come down hard, the wind howling against the windows. He sighed. "Yare yare daze… Guess I’ll just make a run for it."
But before he could step outside, Ai suddenly grabbed his sleeve.
When he turned to look at her, he saw it—that mischievous smile.
The kind that sent warning signals through his brain.
“Shin,” she said sweetly, “looks like you’re stuck here for the night.”
Shin blinked. “I can still leave. I’m not scared of a little—”
BOOM.
A strong gust of wind slammed into the house, rattling the windows. The rain poured down in thick sheets, making it impossible to see beyond a few meters.
Shin’s confident expression faltered.
Ai giggled. “Sooo? Still wanna ‘make a run for it’?”
Shin clicked his tongue. “Tch. Fine, I’ll stay.”
Ai’s smile widened. “Good.”
And just like that, the night took a turn.
—
The Night in Ai’s House
After drying off from the few raindrops that had hit him, Shin sat cross-legged on the couch, arms crossed. “So? What now?”
Ai hummed, twirling her hair. “I was thinking…”
Shin squinted. “Thinking what?”
Ai’s lips curled into a teasing smirk. “It’s the perfect time for… a romantic night alone.”
Shin nearly choked on his own breath. “OI. Don’t say things like that so casually!”
Ai laughed. “Relax, I’m just joking. Or am I?”
Shin groaned. “You’re having way too much fun with this.”
Ai grinned, standing up. “I’ll make us some tea. You, in the meantime, should change into something dry.”
Shin looked down at his clothes. His hoodie was slightly damp from when he had stepped near the entrance earlier.
He sighed. “I don’t have any spare clothes.”
Ai tilted her head. “I could lend you something.”
Shin immediately frowned. “If you even suggest one of your dad’s suits, I swear—”
Ai cut him off. “I was actually thinking of one of my hoodies.”
Shin stared at her, horrified.
Ai shrugged. “They’re oversized. They’ll fit.”
Shin sighed in defeat. This was going to be a long night.
—
An Unexpected Atmosphere
By the time they had settled down, the storm outside had grown even stronger. The sound of rain and wind filled the house, making the inside feel cozy yet oddly intimate.
Shin, now wearing one of Ai’s ridiculously expensive yet surprisingly comfortable hoodies, sat on the floor in front of the couch. Ai sat behind him, leaning against the cushions, sipping her tea.
For a while, neither of them spoke.
“…It’s kinda nice,” Ai finally said, her voice softer than before.
Shin tilted his head. “What is?”
She looked out the window, watching the rain. “Just… moments like this. Just the two of us. No school, no chaos, no interruptions. Just us.”
Shin exhaled, leaning his head back against the couch. “…Yeah. I get that.”
Silence.
Then Ai smiled. “You should stay over more often.”
Shin immediately turned red. “WHA—”
Ai giggled. “I meant platonically. You’re the one making it weird, Shin-chan~.”
Shin clicked his tongue. “You definitely worded that on purpose.”
Ai just smirked, sipping her tea again.
—
Midnight Talks
Later that night, as the storm continued to rage outside, they ended up lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling, talking about random things.
“…You ever think about the future?” Ai suddenly asked.
Shin turned his head slightly toward her. “What do you mean?”
Ai’s voice was quieter now. “I mean, where we’ll be in ten years. Will we still be as close? Will we all still be together?”
Shin was quiet for a moment before he said, “Yeah. I think so.”
Ai turned to look at him. “You’re sure?”
Shin gave her a small smirk. “Of course. You think I’m the type to disappear?”
Ai blinked, then laughed softly. “…No. You’d probably show up at my future office just to annoy me.”
Shin grinned. “Exactly.”
The two of them stayed like that, side by side, the sound of the rain filling the room.
Eventually, Ai yawned. “We should sleep.”
Shin stretched. “Guess so.”
Ai smiled sleepily. “Goodnight, Shin.”
Shin turned his head to look at her one last time before closing his eyes.
“…Goodnight, Ai.”

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 229: Pulled Into the Storm
The rain continued to drum against the windows, filling the silent house with its rhythmic tapping. The storm had begun to ease just a little, but it was still strong enough to make stepping outside impossible.
Shin glanced over at the couch. Ai was curled up, wrapped in a soft blanket, her long hair spilling over the cushions. Her breathing was steady, peaceful.
She had fallen asleep.
Or at least, that’s what he thought.
Shin sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. "She’s gonna get a stiff neck sleeping like that."
Without overthinking it, he bent down, carefully sliding an arm under her legs and another behind her back. With ease, he lifted her into his arms.
A textbook-perfect princess carry.
Ai didn’t stir. She stayed limp, her breathing deep.
Shin rolled his eyes. "Geez, you’re really knocked out, huh?"
He carried her through the hallway, pushing open the door to her room with his foot. The room smelled like her—subtle floral scents mixed with something unmistakably Ai.
As he gently placed her on the bed and pulled the blanket over her, he muttered, "Alright, sleep properly now—"
Then it happened.
In one swift movement, Ai’s arms shot out, grabbing Shin’s wrist.
Before he could react, she pulled him down.
The next thing he knew—he was on the bed with her.
Very, very close.
—
Trapped in Ai’s Hold
Shin’s mind short-circuited.
His body tensed as Ai’s arm stayed wrapped around him, keeping him locked in place. His face was inches from hers, her soft breaths brushing against his skin.
For someone who had been asleep, she sure had a firm grip.
“…Oi.” His voice was low, almost hesitant.
No response.
“Ai.”
Still no response.
Shin gulped. "Did she actually just—"
Then, she spoke.
“…Warm.”
Her voice was soft, muffled against his chest.
Shin froze. His heart definitely skipped a beat.
Ai shifted slightly, adjusting her hold around him, but she didn’t let go.
Shin’s mind raced. What was happening?!
He could feel the warmth of her breath, the gentle rise and fall of her chest. The room was dim, the storm outside making the atmosphere feel surreal.
“…Ai?” His voice came out quieter than he intended.
Then, she smirked.
She was awake.
—
Shin’s Panic, Ai’s Victory
Shin immediately stiffened. "YOU WERE AWAKE?!"
Ai let out a soft giggle. "Mmm… maybe."
Shin tried to sit up, but Ai’s arms tightened around him. "SHE’S NOT LETTING GO."
He narrowed his eyes. "…Ai."
Ai yawned dramatically. “I dunno, Shin… seems like you’re already here.”
Shin twitched.
"Ai, let. Me. Go."
Ai hummed, pretending to think. “Mmm… nope.”
"OI!"
She giggled again, clearly enjoying this way too much. "You’re so easy to fluster."
Shin exhaled sharply, closing his eyes for a second. "Okay, she’s messing with me. Don’t fall for it. Don’t fall for it."
He grabbed her wrist, ready to break free—
—but then Ai snuggled closer.
His entire brain shut down.
“Oi—”
“Mmm…” Ai murmured, resting her forehead lightly against his shoulder. “It’s still raining, Shin. Just for a little while?”
Her voice was softer now, less teasing, more genuine.
Shin stared at the ceiling, completely defeated.
“…You’re impossible.”
Ai smiled against him. “And yet, here you are.”
Shin sighed, shaking his head. "How the hell did this night turn into this?"
But strangely…
He didn’t try to move away again.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 230: Shin Fights Back
The storm outside raged on, wind howling against the windows, rain hammering the glass. Inside, the dim room carried a different kind of tension—one far quieter, yet far more dangerous.
Ai was smirking.
That same infuriating smirk.
Shin had spent years watching her play her little games, teasing him at every opportunity.
But this time?
This time, he wasn’t going to let her win.
Shin exhaled sharply, his lips curling into a slow smirk of his own. "Alright, Ai-chan. You wanna play?"
His fingers, which had been frozen in hesitation, moved.
Smooth. Deliberate.
He slid his hand up her waist.
Ai’s playful expression faltered just a little.
Shin’s smirk widened. "Got you."
He didn’t stop there.
His fingertips brushed over the soft curve of her waist, tracing slowly, deliberately, sending a shiver through her body. Ai inhaled sharply, eyes widening just a fraction.
“Oh?” Shin’s voice was low, smooth, dangerously amused. “What happened to all that confidence just now?”
Ai blinked. "You—"
Before she could finish, Shin leaned in closer.
His breath ghosted over the shell of her ear as he whispered, “You pulled me in, Ai. Don’t tell me you weren’t expecting this?”
She twitched.
For the first time, Ai wasn’t the one in control.
Shin could feel it—her body tensing, caught between instinctively reacting and stubbornly holding her ground.
"You’re…" Ai swallowed. "…really playing along, huh?"
Shin chuckled, voice deep and slow. "You think I wouldn’t?"
His lips barely brushed the skin just below her ear.
Ai visibly shivered.
She quickly turned her head, trying to look at him—only for their noses to brush, their faces now so close that even the space between their breaths had disappeared.
Shin held her gaze.
It was Ai who broke eye contact first.
Shin almost laughed.
Victory.
—
Ai’s Counterattack
But Ai wasn’t one to surrender so easily.
Just as Shin was about to push further, she flipped their positions.
In an instant, Shin found himself pinned—Ai straddling him, hands pressing down on his chest.
He blinked.
She smirked down at him.
“Well, well,” she murmured, tilting her head. “You really thought you had me?”
Shin grinned lazily. "I still do."
Without missing a beat, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her down.
Ai gasped.
Now, their bodies were flush against each other, Ai’s breath caught in her throat.
“…Oi,” she muttered.
Shin arched an eyebrow. “What? You started this, remember?”
For once, Ai was the one flustered.
Shin lifted a hand, his fingers brushing through her hair, before trailing down the back of her neck. Ai inhaled sharply again.
“You…” she whispered.
Shin smirked, enjoying every second of this shift in power. “What? You look a little—”
Ai kissed him.
Shin froze.
It wasn’t like the playful peck from the fake wedding.
This was different.
Deeper. Slower.
Real.
And then, just as quickly, she pulled away, her face hovering inches from his.
Ai licked her lips, smiling.
“…Checkmate.”
Shin exhaled a shaky breath. Damn it.
She still won.

Got it! I’ll write it in a way that shows the tension escalating naturally, leading up to the moment, but then cutting to the morning after, leaving things implied rather than explicitly shown.

Chapter 231
The rain pounded against the windows, the howling wind rattling the trees outside. Inside Ai’s room, the atmosphere was warm—too warm.
Shin had tried to resist at first, but Ai wasn’t having it. The way she pulled him onto the bed, the way her hands clung to his shirt, fingers tightening like she was afraid he’d slip away—it was impossible to ignore.
“Ai…” His voice was lower than usual, a little rough, his heart hammering in his chest.
She was beneath him, her long hair spread out over the pillow, her eyes heavy-lidded as she stared up at him with that smile—the one that told him she had won before the battle even started.
Shin could feel her warmth even through his clothes, her soft breath against his neck. His arms trembled slightly as he hovered over her, trying to regain some semblance of composure.
“Are you still holding back?” Ai whispered, her voice teasing yet full of something deeper.
For once, he didn’t have a comeback.
His fingers trailed up her arm, slowly, deliberately, as if testing himself. Ai didn’t flinch. If anything, she pulled him even closer. The sound of the storm outside was distant now—background noise to the tension thick in the room.
Their breaths mixed, her scent intoxicating. And when she finally closed the small gap between them, pressing her lips to his, Shin knew—there was no stopping now.
He let himself sink into it, one hand slipping under the fabric of her nightwear, feeling the warmth of her skin beneath his fingertips. She shivered—not from the cold, but from anticipation.
The last thing he saw was Ai’s flushed face, her half-lidded gaze, before the lights flickered—
—And then, the morning came.
The golden sunlight seeped through the curtains, casting soft shadows across the room.
Shin’s eyes cracked open, his body feeling oddly heavy. Something warm was curled up beside him, and it took him a moment to process.
Ai.
Her face was buried in his chest, her arms wrapped tightly around his waist, her breathing slow and peaceful. Her hair was a mess, and his shirt—wait, was that his shirt?
He blinked. His head was still a little foggy. The memories of last night rushed back in an instant, and his entire face burned.
“…Shit.”
Ai stirred slightly, a satisfied hum escaping her lips. She nuzzled closer, tightening her hold on him. “Morning, husband.”
Shin stiffened. “Oi.”
She peeked up at him, smirking despite her sleepy state. “What? We already had a wedding. It only makes sense to follow through.”
He groaned, covering his face with his hand. “I seriously let you trick me again…”
Ai giggled, pressing a kiss to his collarbone. “You didn’t seem to mind.”
Shin exhaled, staring at the ceiling, trying to process the sheer absurdity of his life.
And yet… he couldn’t stop the small, helpless smile tugging at his lips.

Chapter 232
Shin and Ai had ascended.
There was no other way to describe it.
When they walked into school that morning, something was different. It was subtle—no drastic changes in appearance, no loud proclamations—but the air around them had shifted.
It was in the way Shin carried himself, shoulders looser, movements smoother, like he had unlocked the final level of confidence. It was in the way Ai smiled—serene, knowing, like she held the secrets of the universe itself.
The others noticed immediately.
Kazama was the first to squint at them. “…What the hell happened to you two?”
Nene, always the sharpest when it came to these things, gasped. She looked back and forth between them, eyes wide with realization, then dramatically clutched her chest like she had been betrayed.
“Wait. No. Don’t tell me—”
Bo-chan, ever the quiet observer, simply hummed in understanding. Masao, on the other hand, turned red like a tomato before he even processed what was going on.
Shin stretched, letting out a content sigh as he settled into his seat. “Hmm? What are you guys freaking out about?”
Ai leaned against the desk beside him, the picture of satisfaction, casually brushing a strand of hair behind her ear.
Nene pointed an accusing finger. “You two—You guys totally—!”
Shin raised an eyebrow. “We totally what?”
Masao made a small strangled sound.
Kazama’s eye twitched. “You know exactly what she’s talking about.”
Shin’s smirk was insufferable. “Do I?”
Ai let out a small, amused hum. She wasn’t even trying to deny it.
“Oh my god,” Nene whispered, covering her mouth in horror. “They’ve seen God.”
Bo-chan nodded sagely. “They’ve reached enlightenment.”
Kazama groaned, rubbing his temples. “This is ridiculous.”
Masao, still red-faced, whispered under his breath, “Does it really change a person this much…?”
Kazama turned to glare at Shin. “You—you are radiating. How is that even possible?!”
Shin grinned. “Maybe I just had a really good night.”
Masao actually choked.
Nene turned to Ai, grasping her by the shoulders. “Ai! Snap out of it! Come back to us!”
Ai tilted her head, a soft, dreamy smile on her lips. “Hmm? But I’m right here.”
“Oh no,” Nene muttered. “We lost her. She’s gone. She’s transcended.”
The chaos continued for a while, their usual classroom dynamic completely upended.
At some point, Kazama just sighed, resigned. “Whatever. As long as you two don’t start being weird about it in public, I don’t care.”
Shin placed a hand over his heart, mock-offended. “Kazama, please. Have some faith in my ability to be subtle.”
Kazama deadpanned. “You’re the least subtle person I know.”
Ai giggled beside him, lacing her fingers with Shin’s under the desk—hidden, just for them.
For all the teasing, for all the chaos, there was something undeniably different.
Something real.
And they both knew it.

Chapter 233
Time flew by.
Before they knew it, the year was nearing its end.
Exams, festivals, the chaos of student council, community service, and even that unforgettable night—everything had been leading up to this moment.
The day the universities would release their acceptance or rejection letters.
The entire group gathered at Shinchan’s home, anticipation thick in the air. The TV was on but muted, its dull flickering light barely noticed. Shin’s parents sat with them, uncharacteristically quiet. Even Hima, usually the ball of energy in the house, sat still, hands clasped together in her lap.
Shin, Ai, and Kazama were waiting.
Waiting for their fate.
Would they be accepted? Would they be rejected?
The trio had worked hard—really hard—but in the end, it all came down to this.
Shin leaned back on the couch, arms crossed, wearing an expression that was way too calm for the situation. Ai, sitting beside him, clutched his sleeve, eyes fixed on her phone. Kazama, on the other hand, was practically shaking, looking like he was about to pass out from stress.
Nene, Masao, and Bo-chan sat across from them, equally tense.
Then—
Ding!
A notification.
Then another.
And another.
Their results had arrived.
For a few seconds, no one moved.
“…Are you gonna open it?” Masao asked, barely above a whisper.
Ai exhaled sharply, unlocking her phone. “Okay… I’m doing it. I’m opening mine.”
Kazama gulped, doing the same. Shin cracked his neck lazily, like he was about to check a casual text message.
“On three?” Ai suggested.
Kazama and Shin nodded.
“One… Two…”
Three.
They clicked.
Silence.
Ai’s eyes widened. Her lips parted slightly.
Kazama froze, phone gripped in his hands like it might shatter.
Shin’s gaze flickered across the screen, scanning the words.
Then—
Ai gasped. “I… I got in.”
Kazama let out a shaky breath. “…Me too.”
All eyes turned to Shin.
He blinked.
Paused.
Then, casually, he turned his phone around to show them the screen.
One word stood out in bold letters.
Accepted.
For a second, there was silence.
Then—
“HE DID IT!!” Hima screamed, jumping onto her brother.
The room exploded into chaos.
Ai practically tackled Shin, arms wrapping around him. “We did it!”
Kazama collapsed onto the couch, looking like he had just survived a near-death experience. “I can’t believe it… I actually got in…”
Masao wiped a tear. “Our boy is leaving us…”
Bo-chan gave a wise nod. “It was inevitable.”
Nene was already grabbing a pillow to smack Shin with. “YOU KNEW YOU’D GET IN, DIDN’T YOU?!”
Shin smirked, dodging the hit. “Hey, I was just waiting for you guys to catch up.”
His parents, who had been watching silently, finally relaxed. Hiroshi sighed in relief. “So my son really is a genius, huh?”
Misae wiped her eyes. “Of course he is.”
It was real.
They were going abroad.
Their future was officially set.
Shin looked around at his friends, his family, Ai holding onto him tightly, and Kazama finally breathing properly again.
He had made his decision long ago, but now… now it was all happening.
A new chapter of their lives was about to begin.
And he couldn’t wait.

Chapter 234
The results were in.
Shin, Ai, and Kazama had all been accepted.
And not just anywhere.
They were going to Stanford University.
It was a surreal moment. The sheer competitiveness of their programs made their admission even more shocking.
Shin Nohara: Bachelor’s in Mathematical and Computational Science, focusing on applied mathematics and physics. A rigorous, research-heavy course that would push even the brightest minds to their limits.


Ai Suotome: Bachelor’s in Business Analytics and Finance, with a minor in International Relations. A prestigious combination that would place her in the heart of the global financial and political world.


Kazama Toru: Bachelor’s in Economics and Strategic Management, with a focus on international business. A program known for producing some of the world’s top business leaders.


To say their achievements were impressive would be an understatement.
Their families were over the moon.
And to celebrate, the Suotome, Nohara, and Kazama families collaborated to throw a grand party.

The Party Night
The venue? A high-end banquet hall, courtesy of Ai’s family, with a mix of elegance and warmth.
Round tables draped in ivory silk, fairy lights hanging from the ceiling, and a huge digital screen at the center displaying the words:
"CONGRATULATIONS, SHIN, AI & KAZAMA!"
The entire gang was there. Nene, Masao, Bo-chan, Hima, their classmates, teachers—even Yonro-sensei had been invited.
Kazama’s parents, usually strict and composed, were visibly emotional—his mother kept dabbing at her eyes. “To think my son is going to Stanford…”
Hiroshi, Shin’s father, looked around, taking in the high-class atmosphere. He leaned toward Shin and muttered, “I feel like I should’ve worn something fancier…”
Misae, however, was in full proud-mom mode. “My son is a genius, after all!”
Ai’s parents, naturally, were beaming. Ai’s father patted Shin on the back. “It’s rare to see you take something seriously, but I always knew you had it in you.”
Shin smirked. “I guess even I have to act cool sometimes.”
Ai rolled her eyes but couldn’t hide her smile.

The Chaos Begins
At the party, the gang sat together, enjoying the luxurious buffet.
Nene raised her glass (of soda). “To Shin, Ai, and Kazama! The three nerds who somehow made it to Stanford!”
Kazama twitched. “Couldn’t you just say something nice?”
Masao sighed dramatically. “Now that you guys are leaving, who will protect us from the horrors of the world?”
Bo-chan nodded wisely. “We’re doomed.”
Hima grinned. “Don’t worry, I’ll take over the Kasukabe Defense Force!”
Shin chuckled. “That’s my sister.”
Just then—
Ai’s grandmother walked in, dramatically wiping her tears with a silk handkerchief.
“My dear Ai-chan is leaving for America… Oh, how fast they grow…”
Ai’s mother sighed. “Mother, please don’t start.”
But then, the grandma’s gaze landed on Shin.
“You! Young man! If you’re going to my granddaughter’s university, does that mean…” She gasped, clasping her hands together. “You’re going to propose soon, aren’t you?!”
Shin nearly choked on his drink. “H-Huh?!”
The entire table erupted into chaos.
Ai turned red. “Grandma!!”
Kazama facepalmed. “It’s happening again…”
Nene smirked. “Oh? Maybe the wedding wasn’t a joke after all?”
Bo-chan sipped his drink. “A long-term investment.”
Masao, tearing up: “I feel like I’m about to lose a best friend and a sister.”
Hima squinted suspiciously. “Onii-chan, is there something you’re not telling us?”
Shin groaned, burying his face in his hands. “Why is this happening at my own celebration party?”

The Night Ends with a Promise
As the party wound down, Shin, Ai, and Kazama stepped outside onto the balcony, looking up at the stars.
The reality was finally setting in.
They were leaving Kasukabe. Leaving Japan. A whole new chapter was waiting for them.
Ai turned to Shin, her expression softer than usual. “…Are you ready for this?”
Shin looked at her, then at Kazama.
Then he grinned. “Of course. I’ve got you guys with me, don’t I?”
Kazama smirked. “Try to keep up, Nohara.”
Ai smiled. “…Let’s do this together.”
The three of them stood there, taking in the moment.
This was just the beginning.
And they were ready for whatever came next.

Chapter 235: New Paths, New Beginnings
The night of the celebration wasn’t just for Shin, Ai, and Kazama.
Because the next morning, the rest of the group also received their results.
And as it turned out, everyone had found their path.
Bo-chan had been accepted into The University of Tokyo, Japan’s most prestigious university. He was pursuing a Bachelor’s in Literature and Philosophy—a perfect fit for his quiet, observant nature.


Masao had somehow managed to get into Tōtsuki Culinary Academy—yes, the same elite, cutthroat academy famous for producing world-class chefs.


Nene had landed a job that shocked everyone—she had become an assistant to Yoko Ogawa, the celebrated writer of The Diving Pool, Hotel Iris, and many more literary works.


“Wait… you’re working under a famous author?” Kazama blinked in disbelief.
Nene crossed her arms proudly. “That’s right! I’m going to help her with research, editing, and writing! I’ll be part of actual book publications!”
Masao, in complete shock, mumbled, “...I honestly thought you’d become a professional housewife.”
A powerful kick met his shin.
“Say that again, and I’ll make sure you don’t live long enough to enter your fancy cooking school,” Nene threatened.
Masao clutched his leg in pain. “I take it back! I take it back!!”

The Gang's Final Meet-up Before the Next Chapter
They all gathered one last time before life would take them on separate journeys.
The Kasukabe Defense Force, the childhood group that had been inseparable, now stood at the edge of their biggest adventure yet.
Sitting at their old hangout spot—the park where they spent their kindergarten and elementary school days—they stared at the sunset.
“This feels weird,” Masao admitted, lying down on the grass. “We’ve been together since we were kids… but now, we’re all going different ways.”
Bo-chan, ever the philosopher, nodded. “Everything changes.”
Nene sighed dramatically. “Ugh, don’t get all poetic. It’s not like we’re never meeting again.”
“But it’s different,” Kazama said, leaning back. “We won’t be in the same town, the same school. We’re really growing up.”
The group fell into a comfortable silence.
Then Shin suddenly stood up and pointed at the sky.
“Alright, listen up!” he declared.
Everyone turned to him.
“This isn’t goodbye. It’s just the season finale before we start a new arc. And when we reunite, we’re going to be even more awesome!”
Ai smirked. “Wow. That almost sounded inspiring coming from you.”
Masao wiped a fake tear. “Our idiot leader has matured…”
Nene grinned. “So, a reunion after we make something of ourselves?”
Shin nodded. “Exactly.”
Kazama smirked. “Fine. Let’s make it a deal. The next time we all meet here, we’ll share everything we’ve accomplished.”
Bo-chan simply said, “Agreed.”
And just like that—
The Kasukabe Defense Force made a promise.
No matter where they went, no matter how much time passed, they would always come back.
Because at the end of the day—
They were still Shin, Ai, Kazama, Nene, Masao, and Bo.
And that would never change.

Graduating high school.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 236: The End of an Era
The day had finally come.
Graduation.
The hall was packed with students, teachers, and proud parents. The air buzzed with a mix of excitement and nostalgia. The graduates were dressed in formal uniforms, wearing their sashes, waiting for their names to be called.
For the students of Kasukabe High, this was the last time they would sit in these chairs as high schoolers.
For Shin, Ai, Kazama, and the rest of the gang, this was the end of a long, chaotic, unforgettable chapter of their lives.

Walking Down Memory Lane
As the ceremony went on, each of them couldn’t help but reflect on their journey.
Kazama, the former perfectionist and nervous wreck, had grown into a confident young man. He was still competitive, still driven, but now he had something he lacked before—balance. He looked over at his "rival", Shin, and smirked. They had pushed each other so much throughout the years, and now they were heading to the same university.


Ai, who had once been just the rich girl with a crush, had become a true leader. She had spent her high school years proving she was more than her wealth, and today, she felt like she had finally done it.


Bo-chan, ever calm and mysterious, had surprised them all with his Tokyo University acceptance. It was like he had always known where life would take him, moving forward at his own steady pace.


Masao, the lovable coward, had changed the most. Who would have thought that the boy who cried over the smallest things would grow into someone determined enough to enter the most elite culinary school in Japan? His dream was set, and he was finally chasing it with everything he had.


Nene, ever ambitious, had already secured a real job before even stepping out of school. She had fought her way into a professional career, even if it wasn’t in acting like she originally dreamed.


And then there was Shin.
The boy who never took anything seriously had somehow aced his SATs, become a co-president, brought back the Kasukabe Defense Force, and was now about to leave Japan to study mathematics and physics abroad.
If someone had told five-year-old Shin that this was his future, he probably would’ve laughed, pulled down his pants, and run off.
But here he was.
Ready.

"And Now, the Valedictorian…"
When the principal took the stage to announce the top student of the year, the entire hall turned silent.
“…and so, it is with great honor that I present this year’s Valedictorian, Nohara Shinnosuke!”
For a full three seconds, no one moved.
Then, absolute chaos erupted.
Students gasped. Teachers whispered. Parents looked through their programs, wondering if this was a typo.
Even Kazama’s eye twitched.
“DID HE JUST SAY NOHARA?!”
Ai, who had been waiting for this moment, just grinned.
Shin stood up, stretching casually as if he had just woken up from a nap. He strolled toward the stage, ignoring the complete disbelief radiating from everyone.
His parents? Beaming.
Himawari? Cheering loudly.
Kazama? Still recovering from shock.
As Shin took the podium, he grabbed the mic, cleared his throat, and said—
“…Well. Bet none of you saw this coming.”
Laughter and applause broke out. Even the teachers, who had suffered under his antics for years, couldn’t help but smile.
He looked out at his classmates, at his friends, at the people who had made these years so fun.
“I could stand here and give you an inspiring speech, but let’s be honest—nobody actually listens to those. So, I’ll just say this.”
He looked over at his parents, his friends, and finally, at Ai.
“…Thanks for putting up with me.”
Another round of laughter.
Shin smirked.
“And to all of us heading off to new adventures—don’t screw it up!”
Cheers erupted.
And with that, the ceremony ended, and the Kasukabe Defense Force officially graduated.

The Afterparty
The Nohara, Suotome, and Kazama families hosted a huge graduation party, inviting everyone from school.
Food, drinks, and celebrations went on late into the night.
Somewhere in the middle of it all, Shin found himself standing outside on the balcony, looking up at the stars.
Ai walked up next to him. “What are you thinking about?”
He exhaled. “…How much has changed. How much is still changing.”
She nudged him. “Nervous?”
“…Maybe a little.”
Ai smiled softly. “Good. That means you care.”
Shin turned to her, the girl who had chased him all these years, the girl who had somehow become his best friend and something more.
“…We’re really doing this, huh?” he murmured.
Ai nodded. “Yeah. We are.”
They stood in comfortable silence for a while.
Then Shin smirked.
“Hey, wanna pull one last legendary prank before we leave?”
Ai groaned. “Shin…”
He grabbed her hand.
“Come on. One for the road?”
She sighed, then grinned.
“Fine. But if we get caught, you’re taking the blame.”
Shin laughed. “Wouldn’t have it any other way.”
And just like that—
The Kasukabe Defense Force ended high school the only way they knew how.
In absolute chaos.

Chapter 237: Welcome to America
Time Skip – Four Months Before University Begins
A busy airport.
People rushed past in all directions—business travelers, families, students arriving for their new lives. The announcements played in English over the loudspeakers, the energy of the city buzzing through the air.
And in the middle of it all, three familiar figures stood, surrounded by suitcases.
Nohara Shinnosuke, dressed casually in a hoodie and ripped jeans, a single duffel bag slung over his shoulder. He looked around with a lazy smirk, taking in the foreign land that would be home for the next few years.


Ai Suotome, dressed in a stylish white coat and boots, holding a designer suitcase in one hand and checking her phone in the other. Despite her usual confidence, her fingers tapped against the screen nervously.


Kazama, wearing a neatly pressed blazer despite the long flight, adjusting his glasses (which he still refused to admit he needed) while rolling his suitcase behind him. His eyes scanned their surroundings, already calculating every step they needed to take next.


They had finally arrived in America.

Reality Hits
Shin stretched. “So, this is it. A whole new country. A whole new life.”
Kazama sighed. “Try to sound a little more serious about it. This is the most important transition of our lives.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Shin waved him off. “We have four months before classes start, so we might as well enjoy it.”
Ai exhaled, putting away her phone. “Our apartment is set, and I already scheduled a meeting with our academic advisors next week.”
Kazama nodded. “We should also look into opening bank accounts, getting phone plans, and handling our student visas—”
Shin interrupted with a yawn. “Or we could get food first.”
Ai groaned. “Shin—”
“Think about it. We just landed in America. Do we start our journey with paperwork or giant burgers and fries?”
Ai and Kazama exchanged a look.
“…Fine,” Ai admitted. “But only because I haven’t eaten since the flight.”
Kazama rubbed his temples. “Why do I feel like I’ll be the only responsible adult in this group?”
Shin grinned. “Welcome to hell, buddy.”

Their New Home
After grabbing food, they finally arrived at their apartment complex, located near campus.
The place was modern, spacious, and had three separate rooms for each of them. Their parents had helped them find a good place to stay together—Kazama for practicality, Ai for comfort, and Shin because he didn’t trust himself to live alone.
As soon as they walked in, Shin threw himself onto the couch and spread out like a king.
“…I live here now.”
Ai rolled her eyes, dragging her suitcase toward her room. “At least pretend to help unpack.”
Kazama sighed. “This is going to be a nightmare.”
But despite his complaints, the three of them knew—
Their biggest adventure had just begun.

Chapter 238: Shinchan, The Accidental Idol
After dropping off their luggage and freshening up with long-awaited showers, the trio stepped out into the evening air, ready to grab their first proper meal in America.
The streets were alive with the warm glow of city lights, the sound of cars, and the chatter of people walking past. The air smelled of grilled meat, fried food, and fresh bread from nearby restaurants.
But as soon as they entered a well-known fast-food spot, something… strange started happening.

The Idol Effect
Shin was getting stared at.
Like, a lot.
At first, Ai and Kazama thought it was just their imagination. But as they sat down near the counter, they noticed a group of girls whispering at a nearby table, sneaking glances at Shin. A couple of guys, too, nudged each other while looking in his direction.
Ai frowned. “Why do I feel like everyone’s looking at you?”
Kazama adjusted his collar. “More like staring.”
Shin, who had been casually stretching in his oversized hoodie, looked around. “Huh?”
And then it hit them.
Shin wasn’t just attractive—he had the ultimate combination of traits that made him impossible to ignore.
Tall and built. Years of Kendo training had sculpted his body—broad shoulders, defined muscles, and a naturally athletic frame.


Effortlessly cool. His messy black hair, carefree expression, and relaxed posture gave off an air of effortless confidence.


Exotic appeal. In a foreign country, his Japanese features stood out, but instead of looking lost or awkward, he looked like he owned the place.


That damn hoodie. Slightly oversized, casually thrown on—but the way it fit him made it look like a fashion statement.


It didn’t help that when Shin spoke, it was in perfect, casual English.
“Yo, can I get a large fries and a shake?” he said smoothly at the counter.
The girl taking his order blinked.
“…Uh… yeah, sure! Right away!” she stammered, suddenly standing up straighter.
Kazama exhaled sharply. “This is unfair.”
Ai crossed her arms, frowning. “When did he become this… cool?”
Shin, completely oblivious, just hummed to himself while tapping his fingers against the counter.

The Fans Grow
By the time they got their food and sat down, things escalated.
A girl subtly took a selfie with Shin in the background.


A group of guys at another table whispered, clearly trying to figure out who he was.


A cashier at the back nudged her co-worker and pointed directly at him.


Kazama took a deep breath. “Shin. You’re causing a scene.”
Shin blinked. “Huh? What scene?”
Ai leaned in, lowering her voice. “Shin, I think they think you’re some kind of idol or model.”
Shin frowned, picking up a fry. “That’s dumb. I’m just a guy.”
Kazama pushed up his glasses. “You’re a ridiculously attractive guy with a strong presence, perfect English, and the body of an action star.”
“…Oh.”
Ai narrowed her eyes. “Don’t ‘oh’ me.”
Shin, still unbothered, simply smirked. “Well, can’t help it if I’m built different.”
Ai grabbed a napkin and threw it at his face.

Escape Plan
By the time they finished eating, a group of people had subtly migrated closer to their table, trying to act casual.
Kazama sighed, standing up. “We need to leave before someone asks for a picture.”
Ai grabbed her bag. “Agreed. Shin, put your hood up.”
Shin raised an eyebrow. “What, am I some celebrity now?”
Ai and Kazama stared at him.
“…Fine, fine.” He pulled his hoodie over his head, but honestly, it made him look even more like a famous actor dodging paparazzi.
As they walked out, a girl mustered up the courage to speak.
“Uh, hey! Sorry to bother you, but… are you, like, famous in Japan?”
Shin paused.
Ai and Kazama tensed.
Shin turned around, smiled… and simply said—
“…Nah, just a guy who likes fries.”
Then he shoved another fry in his mouth and walked out.
Ai sighed. “This is going to be a problem.”
Kazama groaned. “A huge problem.”
Meanwhile, Shin—completely unbothered—popped another fry into his mouth.

Chapter 239: Settling into the American Life
The first few days in America were a mix of excitement, confusion, and mild suffering.
Sure, they had landed safely, found a place to stay, and even accidentally caused a scene at a fast-food joint (thanks to Shin). But now came the real challenge—getting used to daily life in a completely new country.

Step 1: House Rules & Division of Labor
On their second morning, the three of them sat around the small dining table, discussing how to survive without killing each other.
Kazama, naturally, had already written a detailed plan.
“Alright,” he said, flipping open his notebook, “we need a system.”
Ai crossed her arms. “Sounds fair. We’re all adults now.”
Shin, sprawled on the couch, lazily nodded. “Mhm. System. Sure.”
Kazama ignored him and continued.
Household Responsibilities:
Cooking: Ai (Primary) / Kazama (Backup) / Shin (Absolute last resort)


Cleaning: Shin (Primary) / Kazama (Backup) / Ai (Supervision)


Laundry: Shared, but whoever notices first should do it.


Grocery Shopping: Shin & Ai (Kazama is banned after last time)


Bills & Budgeting: Kazama (obviously)


Shin raised an eyebrow. “Why am I the main cleaner?”
Kazama deadpanned. “Because you have insane stamina and you’re too lazy to cook.”
Ai added, “And I don’t trust you in the kitchen after what happened last time.”
Shin gasped, offended. “That fire was barely a fire.”
Kazama and Ai spoke in unison.
 “THERE SHOULD NEVER BE FIRE.”

Step 2: Setting Up the Essentials
Now that they had divided responsibilities, they needed to get their lives in order.
First priority: SIM cards.
So, they walked to a nearby mobile store and got their local numbers.
Shin, while setting up his phone, muttered in Japanese, “Man, I’m gonna miss my old ringtone.”
The employee assisting them suddenly perked up.
“Oh! Are you guys from Japan?”
Kazama tensed. Ai froze.
Shin just smiled. “Yeah.”
The employee, a college-aged guy, grinned. “Dude, that’s so cool! I love anime.”
Kazama sighed. Here we go.

Step 3: Exploring the Neighborhood
After sorting out their phone numbers, the trio decided to take a walk around the area.
They found a 24-hour convenience store nearby. Shin immediately tested out the American snack selection.


A gym that Shin immediately bookmarked.


A café that Ai liked the vibe of.


A bookstore that Kazama dragged them into for half an hour.


A park where a group of kids were playing basketball.


While passing a row of houses, they noticed some of their neighbors outside.
One of them, a friendly old lady, waved at them. “Hello there! New in the neighborhood?”
Ai smiled politely. “Yes, we just moved in.”
“Oh, lovely! I’m Mrs. Patterson. If you ever need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.”
Shin smiled back. “Thanks, Mrs. P.”
She chuckled. “Oh my, you’re a charmer, aren’t you?”
Kazama muttered. “It’s already starting again.”

Step 4: Home Sweet Home (Kinda)
By the end of the day, they were mentally exhausted but feeling a bit more settled.
They sat in their apartment, sipping on drinks, reflecting on everything.
Ai sighed. “Okay, we survived the first few days. Not bad.”
Kazama nodded. “At least we’re figuring things out.”
Shin stretched. “And I found good fries. That’s what really matters.”
Ai and Kazama just stared at him.
“…What?”
Kazama sighed. “Let’s just sleep.”

And with that, their American adventure truly began.
To be continued in Chapter 240.

Chapter 240: The First Day of University
In just four months, Shin, Ai, and Kazama had gone from confused newcomers to almost blending in with American culture.
They had developed their own routines, habits that made them feel like they had lived here for years.
Kazama had fully embraced the "coffee addict" lifestyle. Every morning, he religiously visited the same café, ordering his black coffee with two shots of espresso, while scrolling through financial news.


Shin had become a regular at the gym, befriending people there, casually lifting weights heavier than what most could manage.


Ai spent most of her free time at the university library, even before classes had started, reading up on business trends and economic theories.


And just like that—the first day of university arrived.

The Morning Chaos
The trio had set alarms the night before. But, of course, Shin ignored his.
Kazama knocked on his door. “Shin, get up.”
No response.
Ai sighed, grabbed a pillow, and threw it at Shin’s face. “Wake up, lazy ass!”
Shin groaned. “Five more minutes.”
Kazama narrowed his eyes. “We have Orientation Day.”
Shin suddenly sat up, serious. “Oh yeah. The day we pretend to be normal.”
Ai rolled her eyes. “Let’s go before we’re late.”

First Impressions at University
Their university was massive. Huge buildings, endless green spaces, and students from all over the world.
As they walked through campus, they immediately stood out.
Ai carried herself with confidence, already looking like a student who belonged in business and finance.


Kazama looked every bit the serious, ambitious student, adjusting his glasses (which he only wore for reading).


Shin… well, Shin looked like an idol. His height, broad shoulders, and ripped physique from Kendo had people staring.


It didn’t help that when they walked into the main hall, a group of American students whispered,
 “Who’s the model?”
 “No way he’s a freshman.”
 “Damn, what’s his major? Sports Science?”
Shin smirked. "Mathematical and Computational Science."
The students paused. “Wait… what?”

Meeting New People
Orientation Day was filled with introductions, presentations, and meeting professors.
Kazama was already networking with business professors.
 Ai was making connections in her field.
 And Shin?
Well.
Shin was being flirted with. A lot.
At one point, a girl approached him, flipping her hair.
 “So, you’re from Japan? That’s hot.”
Shin blinked. “Uh. Thanks?”
Ai grabbed his arm possessively.
 “He’s taken.”
The girl pouted. “Aw. Too bad.”
Kazama just sighed. “This is going to be a long year.”

Settling In
By the end of the day, the trio sat in a campus café, drinking coffee.
Ai sighed. “Okay. First day wasn’t bad.”
Kazama nodded. “We’ll have to work hard, though. This is no joke.”
Shin smirked. “Let’s just see how this ride goes.”
And so, their university journey officially began.
To be continued in Chapter 241.
You said:
they had their first class each of them differnt, but some of ai and kazama matched, they get to see alot of new people, from a varied different places.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 241: The First Class
The first official day of university had arrived. Unlike Orientation, this time, there were no welcoming speeches, no introductions—just pure academics.
The trio had different schedules based on their majors, but Ai and Kazama shared a few classes. Shin, however, was mostly on his own.

Morning Rush
The apartment was a chaotic mess as they scrambled to get ready.
Kazama, as usual, was the first one up, dressed sharply and already sipping his coffee.
 Ai was organizing her notes, ensuring she had everything.
 Shin… was still in bed.
Ai threw a book at him. “Shin, wake up!”
Shin groaned, rolling over. “Why do classes start so early? This is oppression.”
Kazama sighed. “Says the guy who can solve advanced calculus in his sleep.”
Still half-asleep, Shin mumbled as he sat up, “Not my fault math is easy.”
Ai rolled her eyes. “Whatever. Just get dressed. We’re leaving in ten.”

Shin's First Class: Advanced Applied Mathematics
Shin’s first class was an upper-level Applied Mathematics course. He had expected to see a mix of students, but to his surprise, he was one of the youngest there.
The moment he walked in, students whispered.
"Wait, is he a freshman?"
 "No way, that guy looks like an athlete, not a math major."
 "Why does he look like he should be in a K-drama?"
Shin sighed. It was high school all over again.
The professor, an older man with graying hair and glasses, walked in and immediately started writing complex equations on the board. No introductions, no explanations—just pure, unfiltered math.
Shin smirked. "Now this... I can work with."

Ai & Kazama’s First Class: Business Analytics
Meanwhile, Ai and Kazama had their first shared class in Business Analytics.
The room was filled with students from all over the world.
A girl from Germany was discussing economic trends with someone from China.


A guy from India was sharing insights on global markets.


A group of Americans were passionately debating stock investments.


Kazama, naturally, found it fascinating. Ai, on the other hand, immediately analyzed the competition.
As the professor introduced himself, he said,
 "This course will be one of the hardest you take in your business degree. If you're not ready for that, feel free to leave now."
No one moved.
Ai smirked. "Challenge accepted."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "This is going to be interesting."

Lunch Break: Regrouping
After their first classes, the trio met up for lunch at a campus café.
Kazama sighed. “That professor wasn’t kidding. This is going to be tough.”
Ai grinned. “I love it.”
Shin stretched. “My professor didn’t even introduce himself. Just threw equations at us like we were born knowing them.”
Ai smirked. “And?”
Shin shrugged. “I solved them.”
Kazama shook his head. “Of course you did.”
As they ate, they watched the campus life unfold around them—so many people from different backgrounds, different countries, all gathered in one place.
For the first time, it really sank in.
They weren’t in Japan anymore.
They had officially started a new chapter in their lives.

To be continued in Chapter 242.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 241: The First Class
The first day of university had arrived, and with it came a whole new world of experiences. Unlike high school, this wasn’t about managing school festivals or dealing with the chaotic Kasukabe Defense Force. This was serious.
The three had different majors, different schedules, and different classrooms, making this the first time in years they wouldn't be studying together.

Morning: The Rush to University
The apartment was a battlefield.
Kazama was already dressed in his crisp shirt and blazer, sipping coffee like a seasoned office worker.
 Ai was checking and re-checking her notes, making sure everything was in order.
 Shin, as expected, was still in bed, half-buried under his blanket.
Ai scowled, grabbing a book and hurling it at his head.
 "Shin, wake up!"
The book bounced off his forehead, making him groan.
"Why do classes start so early?" he grumbled, rubbing his face. "This is oppression."
Kazama sighed. "Says the guy who solves calculus problems in his sleep."
Shin sat up lazily, his hair a complete mess. “Not my fault math is easy.”
Ai rolled her eyes. "Get dressed. We're leaving in ten."

Shin’s First Class: Advanced Applied Mathematics
Shin’s first class was Advanced Applied Mathematics.
The moment he stepped inside the large lecture hall, he felt eyes on him.
It wasn’t just the usual "new student" glances. It was shock.
Whispers spread like wildfire.
"Wait, is he a freshman?"
 "No way, that guy looks like a sports major."
 "Dude, why does he look like a K-pop idol?"
 "Hold on, isn’t this an upper-level class? What’s he doing here?"
Shin sighed internally. Great. High school all over again.
He found an empty seat somewhere in the middle and slouched down, pretending not to care.
The professor entered, an older man with graying hair and glasses, and without a word, began writing equations on the board.
No introductions. No syllabus review. Just pure, raw math.
The first equation was a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), already halfway solved.
"Solve for u(x,t) using separation of variables."
Shin blinked. They were jumping straight into this?
Other students were already flipping through their textbooks, some even whispering in mild panic.
He cracked his knuckles, flipped open his notebook, and began writing. Within minutes, he had the solution.
The professor turned around, eyes scanning the class. “Who here can solve this?”
Silence.
Shin, bored, leaned back and lazily raised his hand.
Some students turned to look at him, confused.
The professor raised an eyebrow. “Go ahead.”
Shin walked up to the board, grabbed the marker, and effortlessly wrote out the full solution, step by step.
A murmur spread across the room.
"He did it that fast?"
 "Wait, that’s correct, right?"
 "Who the hell is this guy?"
The professor scrutinized the answer, then turned back to Shin.
 “Correct.”
Shin simply shrugged and went back to his seat, ignoring the stares.
"Who is this guy?"

Ai & Kazama’s First Class: Business Analytics
Meanwhile, Ai and Kazama were in their shared Business Analytics course.
The classroom was large, with students from all over the world.
A girl from Germany was discussing economic trends with a student from China.


A guy from India was talking about global market shifts.


A group of Americans were debating stock investments.


Ai’s sharp eyes scanned the room. The competition was strong.
The professor, a sharp-dressed woman in her 40s, walked in and set down her briefcase.
 "This course will be one of the most challenging in your degree. If you're not ready for that, you may leave now."
No one moved.
"Good. Let's begin. What is the biggest factor in business forecasting failure?"
Hands shot up.
Kazama raised his hand. The professor nodded at him.
"Overreliance on historical data," he answered confidently.
The professor smiled slightly. "Good answer. But not quite."
Ai smirked. Her turn. She raised her hand.
"The biggest factor is human error in interpreting patterns. People assume past trends will continue, but they fail to account for external shocks—like global pandemics, political shifts, or natural disasters."
The professor grinned.
"Now that's the right answer. What's your name?"
"Suotome Ai," she said with confidence.
The professor nodded. “I expect you to keep up this energy, Suotome.”
Kazama sighed. “Of course she would be the teacher’s favorite on the first day.”
Ai just smiled smugly.

Lunch Break: Regrouping
After their first classes, the trio met up at a campus café.
Kazama sighed. “That professor wasn’t kidding. This is going to be tough.”
Ai grinned. “I love it.”
Shin stretched. “My professor didn’t even introduce himself. Just threw equations at us like we were born knowing them.”
Ai smirked. “And?”
Shin shrugged. “I solved them.”
Kazama shook his head. “Of course you did.”
As they ate, they watched the campus life unfold around them—so many people from different backgrounds, different countries, all gathered in one place.
For the first time, it really sank in.
They weren’t in Japan anymore.
They had officially started a new chapter in their lives.

To be continued in Chapter 242.
You said:
new connection and cross connection were made(as in people from ai and kazama's course met shin and vice versa).
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 242: New Connections and Crossroads
The first week of university was nothing short of a whirlwind. New people, new schedules, new environments—and despite being in different courses, Shin, Ai, and Kazama's worlds began overlapping.
It wasn’t long before their names started circulating among different circles.
Kazama and Ai were already making a name for themselves in Business Analytics and Finance, while Shin—despite his lack of effort—had somehow become the topic of conversation in math-heavy courses.
But what truly set things in motion was when their classmates started meeting each other.

Kazama’s Business Friend Meets Shin
One afternoon, Kazama was at a café on campus, going over notes with a classmate—Daniel Carter, a sharp-minded finance major from New York.
Daniel was practical, quick-witted, and always two steps ahead when it came to money. His family ran a well-known investment firm, but he wasn’t just riding on their coattails—he had a talent for numbers and risk assessment.
As the two were discussing case studies, Shin walked in.
“Yo, Kazama,” Shin greeted lazily, his presence immediately catching attention.
Daniel glanced up, then leaned in to Kazama. “Wait, that’s the guy from the math department, right?”
Kazama sighed. “Yes. Unfortunately.”
Shin sat down and stretched. “Man, I’m starving. Hey, what’s up?” He glanced at Daniel. “Who’s this?”
“Kazama’s new business nerd friend,” Daniel said smoothly, smirking.
Shin blinked, then grinned. “Cool. I’m Shin.”
Daniel chuckled. “Yeah, I’ve heard. You’re the dude who casually solves complex equations like it’s middle school math.”
Shin just shrugged. “I mean, it kinda is.”
Daniel laughed. “Damn, confident. I like it.”
Kazama groaned. “Please don’t encourage him.”
But it was already too late.
Shin and Daniel hit it off instantly, talking about probability, risk, and even betting on theoretical scenarios.
 Before long, Daniel was dragging Shin into stock market debates, and Shin, just for fun, started throwing in mathematical probability theories to predict market movements.
Kazama sighed. This was dangerous.

Ai’s Debate Rival Meets Shin & Kazama
Meanwhile, Ai had found herself an academic rival.
Her name was Sophia Moreau, a brilliant and sharp-tongued international student from France. She was in Business and International Relations, just like Ai, and the two had clashed in almost every classroom discussion.
Naturally, Ai loved the challenge.
One evening, after a heated classroom debate, Sophia followed Ai to the café where Shin and Kazama were already sitting.
Ai smirked. “So, you’re stalking me now?”
Sophia scoffed. “I was going to get coffee. Not my fault you’re here.”
Kazama raised an eyebrow. “Who’s this?”
Sophia crossed her arms. “Sophia Moreau. Ai’s competition.”
Shin looked her up and down, then nodded. “She definitely looks like your type of rival.”
Sophia narrowed her eyes. “And who are you?”
Shin grinned. “The boyfriend.”
Sophia blinked. “Wait… you’re the genius math guy, aren’t you?”
Kazama groaned. “Why does everyone call him that?”
Ai smirked. “Because it’s true.”
Sophia sat down, completely intrigued now. “So, the rumors are true. You’re a math genius and a kendo guy?”
Shin shrugged. “I guess.”
Sophia rolled her eyes. “Great. Another overachiever.”
Ai laughed. “Oh no, he’s the laziest genius you’ll ever meet.”
Sophia found that both annoying and fascinating.
By the end of the conversation, Sophia, Ai, Kazama, and Shin had somehow roped themselves into a debate about logic, finance, and whether or not Shin could actually predict market crashes with math.
Shin vs. Sophia was unexpectedly entertaining, and Ai, for once, was watching from the sidelines instead of being in the heat of the debate.
Kazama sighed. Why did their lives feel like a sitcom?

More Cross-Connections
Shin’s Math Professor & Ai’s Finance Professor:
 Both recognized Shin and Ai as standouts in their respective fields and joked about how they were dating, saying, “A math genius and a business prodigy—sounds like a power couple.” Ai, naturally, agreed. Shin just nodded lazily.


Kazama’s Group Project Member Knew Shin’s Gym Trainer:
 One of Kazama’s project members, Ethan, turned out to be close friends with Shin’s gym trainer. This led to a hilarious conversation where Ethan thought Shin was a professional athlete, not a math major.


A Barista Recognized Them from Campus Debates:
 A random barista at the café recognized Ai and Sophia’s heated debates and jokingly asked Shin and Kazama, “How do you survive between those two?” Kazama: "We don’t."


Bo & Masao's Campus Updates:
 Bo was already making waves at Tokyo University, while Masao was struggling under the extreme pressure of Tōtsuki Culinary Academy. Their group chats were filled with updates, pictures, and occasional cries for help from Masao.



The Foundation of a New Social Circle
By the end of the first month, their worlds had fully blended.
Shin, Ai, and Kazama weren’t just “the three Japanese students” anymore. They had met people from around the world, forming an unexpectedly chaotic but brilliant social web.
From finance nerds to gym junkies, their social circle had become a blend of intellect, competition, and absolute stupidity.
Kazama groaned. "This is gonna be a long four years."
Shin grinned. "Yeah. But it'll be fun."
Ai smirked. "Obviously. We wouldn’t have it any other way."

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 243: The Man Who Was Too Much Like Me
Shin was bored.
University life wasn’t bad—he liked the people, the new environment, and the food was decent. But the classes?
Hell no.
It wasn’t that he couldn’t keep up. If anything, it was the opposite. Everything was moving at a painfully slow pace for him. The professors explained concepts he could solve half-asleep, drunk, and upside down.
After about a month, he started bunking lectures.
Kazama had tried to lecture him about it (ironically), Ai had sighed in exasperation, and their new friends thought it was hilarious that the so-called “math prodigy” couldn’t be bothered to attend math classes.
One afternoon, instead of sitting through another lecture on linear algebra (which he already mastered years ago), Shin decided to explore the campus.
It was autumn, and the trees were losing their leaves, a crisp breeze rolling through the open walkways of the university. He wandered towards a secluded courtyard near an old faculty building, hands stuffed into his jacket pockets, thinking about absolutely nothing.
Until he heard a voice behind him.
“Shouldn’t you be in class, kid?”
Shin turned, half-expecting a security guard or an angry professor.
Instead, he found himself staring at a man—no, a legend of laziness.
The guy looked like an older, scruffier, and somehow even more reckless version of himself.
Messy hair? Check.


Slightly unshaven but in a way that looked intentional? Check.


Slouched posture? Check.


A completely unimpressed look in his eyes? Check.


The man leaned back against a bench, arms stretched over the backrest, watching Shin with an expression that could only be described as mild curiosity mixed with complete disinterest.
Shin blinked. “Shouldn’t you be in class, old man?”
The guy snorted. “I teach the class, dumbass.”
Shin narrowed his eyes. “Then why aren’t you there?”
The man grinned lazily. “Because it’s boring as hell.”
Shin’s respect for the guy increased immediately.

Professor Alexander "Alex" Hawthorne
That was how Shin met Alexander Hawthorne, a renowned professor in mathematical physics, known for:
Skipping his own lectures because “everything in the textbook is on the syllabus anyway.”


Pissing off the department heads by solving equations in the most unconventional ways possible.


Sleeping in his office, on the grass, or literally anywhere but his own home.


Being scarily brilliant but also an absolute pain in the ass to deal with.


And, unfortunately, he and Shin did not get along.
At least, not at first.

First Conversation: A Clash of Two Similar Idiots
Shin sat down on the opposite bench, stretching out his legs.
"So, Professor, if you're skipping class, why are you bothering me about it?"
Hawthorne smirked. “Because I don’t care about my students, but I do care about interesting people.”
Shin blinked. “Uh… thanks?”
The professor lazily pointed at him. “I’ve heard about you. Shin Nohara, the Japanese kid who doesn’t study but still aces every test.”
Shin tilted his head. “And?”
Hawthorne leaned forward. “You remind me of myself. And that annoys the hell out of me.”
Shin grinned. “Yeah? You remind me of myself too. And that annoys me.”
The professor stared at him. Shin stared back.
Neither blinked.
Neither moved.
It was a silent battle of egos.
Finally, Hawthorne sighed and leaned back. “Wanna drink?”
Shin smirked. “Aren’t you a professor?”
Hawthorne pulled out a can of soda from his coat. “Yeah, but I meant this, smartass.”
Shin took the soda and cracked it open.
And just like that, a weird, chaotic, and reluctant mentor-student relationship began.

A Meeting That Changed Everything
Over the next few weeks, Shin kept running into (or being dragged into) conversations with Professor Hawthorne.
At first, they mostly insulted each other.
Then, they debated theories.
Then, Hawthorne started giving Shin random complex problems—ones that weren’t even in their curriculum.
At some point, it stopped being about bunking classes and started being about learning from the one person who could actually challenge him.
And whether he realized it or not, this man would change the course of his life forever.
To be continued in Chapter 244.

Professor Hawthorne wanting to really show shin's his place(in a nice way to help him) gave him a problem known to be unsolvable which shin didnt know, to make him rack his brain and bring him down from the skys. the problem was Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness, including both mathematics and fluid dynamic, hence physiscs. he gave this as a challenge after shin did or said something.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 244: Bringing the Prodigy Back to Earth
Shin had done it again.
He had pissed off Professor Hawthorne.
Not in the normal way, like skipping classes. No, this time, Shin had done something far worse.

The Incident: Shin’s Big Mouth
It all started during one of their usual debates. They were in the university library, seated at a secluded table near a window. It was autumn, the golden leaves swirling outside as students passed by.
Hawthorne had casually tossed a question at Shin—a complex mathematical physics problem—expecting him to struggle.
Shin solved it in three minutes.
While eating chips.
With one hand.
And then, with the cockiest smirk imaginable, he slid the answer sheet back to the professor and said,
“Man, is this really the best you’ve got? I thought you were supposed to be a genius.”
The entire library might as well have gone silent.
Professor Hawthorne froze.
Shin, still munching on chips, grinned.
The older man narrowed his eyes.
And that was the moment Shin sealed his fate.

The Challenge: A Problem Meant to Break Him
Hawthorne let out a slow, deep sigh and leaned forward.
“Alright, kid. Since you think you’re hot shit, I’ve got a problem for you.”
Shin raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Hit me with it.”
Hawthorne grabbed a notebook, flipped to a blank page, and started writing.
Slowly.
Deliberately.
Each symbol he wrote felt heavier than the last.
Shin leaned in, watching as the page filled with equations, integrals, and fluid dynamics notations.
He recognized bits and pieces—Navier-Stokes equations, fundamental to understanding fluid mechanics. But something was off. The way Hawthorne was presenting it… something didn’t feel right.
When the professor finally finished, he slid the notebook to Shin.
“Solve this.”
Shin glanced at it, still smirking. “Tch. That’s it?”
Hawthorne smirked back. “You tell me.”
Shin cracked his knuckles and got to work.

Minutes Turned to Hours
At first, Shin was confident. He worked through the first few derivations easily.
But as he dug deeper, the equations became murkier.
The solution refused to take shape. The deeper he went, the more impossible it became.
His pen slowed.
His cocky expression faded.
After an hour, he leaned back, rubbing his temple.
Something was wrong.
He glanced at Hawthorne, who was watching him with an amused expression.
“What’s the matter? I thought this was too easy for you?”
Shin scowled. “What even is this?”
Hawthorne smirked. “Oh, just one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics and physics.”
Shin’s entire world paused.
“…Wait.”
Hawthorne casually sipped his coffee. “Yup. The Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness Problem.”
Shin stared at him.
“You gave me a fucking Millennium Prize Problem?”
Hawthorne grinned. “Oh, so now you’re interested?”
Shin ran a hand through his hair. “Holy shit… I’ve been trying to solve a problem that has no known solution?”
Hawthorne leaned forward, resting his chin on his hands.
“Listen, kid. You’re smart. Really smart. But the moment you think you’re untouchable, you stop growing.”
Shin stared at the equations again, his pride crumbling.
Hawthorne continued.
“You’re a damn genius, but there are problems in this world that not even the greatest minds can solve. You’ve been walking around thinking you’re on top of the world.”
“Welcome back to Earth.”
Shin exhaled. His mind was racing, but for the first time in years, he wasn’t feeling bored.
He was feeling challenged.
And damn it… it was exciting.
To be continued in Chapter 245.
You said:
proposition by the professor to help him with his research, also to solve the problem.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 245: The Proposition
Shin hadn’t slept.
The Navier-Stokes problem had infected his mind. Even as he went through his day, ate food, attended (or rather, skipped) classes, the equations wouldn’t leave him alone.
At night, he found himself scribbling in a notebook, attempting different approaches, yet always hitting a wall.
And yet… he loved it.
For the first time in years, he wasn’t coasting. He wasn’t sleepwalking through challenges. He was stuck, struggling, and it felt exhilarating.

Professor Hawthorne’s Offer
The next evening, he returned to Hawthorne’s office, notebooks filled with failed attempts.
The old man was already expecting him, casually reading a paper, a cup of coffee in his hand.
Without looking up, he said, “So? You crack the code yet?”
Shin slumped into the chair opposite him, tossing his notebook on the table.
“No. And I hate that I love this.”
Hawthorne chuckled, finally looking up.
“Good. Now you’re ready to actually learn.”
Shin raised an eyebrow. “That wasn’t learning?”
“No, that was just you flailing in the dark.”
He leaned forward, tapping a folder on his desk.
“You want in on this? On actual cutting-edge research?”
Shin blinked. “Wait… what?”
Hawthorne smirked. “I’m giving you an opportunity, kid. Join my research team. Work with me on fluid dynamics, applied mathematics, and computational physics. We’re tackling the hardest problems out there—including Navier-Stokes.”
Shin’s heart pounded.
This was big.
Not just some internship—this was an invitation to real research, working alongside one of the best minds in the field.
But Hawthorne wasn’t done.
“Of course… this isn’t just an honorary title. If you say yes, you’re going to be put through hell. This won’t be you just waltzing in with raw talent. You’re going to have to work. Hard.”
“And if you fail, I’ll drop you without hesitation.”
Shin stared at him, the weight of the offer settling in.
A few months ago, he might have laughed and walked away.
But now?
He felt alive.
He smirked. “You’re really good at making things sound terrifying.”
Hawthorne grinned. “And you’re really good at acting like you have a choice. You were going to say yes the moment I said ‘Navier-Stokes.’”
Shin chuckled. “Fair.”
And just like that… his life took a new turn.

Meanwhile…
At dinner, Ai and Kazama immediately noticed something was off.
Shin was too quiet.
Not his usual laziness. Not boredom.
No, this was focused intensity.
Ai raised an eyebrow. “Alright, spill. What happened?”
Shin, still lost in thought, muttered, “I think I just accidentally signed up for the hardest challenge of my life.”
Kazama smirked. “Oh? And you’re not backing out?”
Shin looked at his notebook, equations spilling across the pages.
“No way in hell.”

Chapter 246: The News Spreads
At first, it was just a few whispers.
Some students in the applied mathematics department caught wind of it, then the computational physics students started talking. By noon the next day, the entire science department was buzzing with the news—
A first-year had been invited to join Professor Hawthorne’s research team.
And not just any first-year. Shinnosuke Nohara.
A guy who, up until now, had a reputation for being unbothered, a bit too laid-back, and someone who barely took anything seriously.
“He’s the one who speaks perfect English but skips half his classes, right?”
“I heard he answered a professor’s question in his sleep once.”
“Wait, isn’t he also in the Kendo club? And Student Council? And Debate?”
“This is the same guy who ordered fries like a movie star on day one, right?”
Naturally, the rumors morphed as they spread. Some claimed he had solved the Navier-Stokes problem. Others said he had mocked Hawthorne and got challenged to prove himself. One even said Hawthorne had begged him to join.
No one knew the truth, but one thing was certain—Shin had done something impossible.
First-years weren’t even allowed in Hawthorne’s research group. It was a strict rule—you had to be at least a second-year to even be considered. And yet, somehow, Shin had been invited personally.
By evening, Kazama and Ai finally caught wind of it.
“Wait, you’re telling me Shin is doing research? With Hawthorne?” Kazama’s fork hovered mid-air, his usual composed expression cracking. “How the hell did that happen?”
Ai, on the other hand, simply sighed and smiled. “Of course, it had to be him. That idiot always ends up doing the impossible.”
Kazama leaned back. “I honestly thought he’d slack off through university. This is insane.”
Ai smirked. “It’s Shin. He was always smart. He just… never cared enough to try.”
Kazama shook his head, still trying to process it. “Well, looks like he cares now.”
Ai’s gaze softened as she glanced towards where Shin usually sat in the dining hall. He wasn’t there.
And she had a feeling this was just the beginning.
New faces. New challenges. A new world.
Shinnosuke Nohara had stepped into something far bigger than himself.
And soon, it would change everything.

It was unnatural—even Kazama, who was used to waking up early for his morning coffee, found it disturbing to see Shin already dressed and ready to leave before he even stepped out of his room.
At first, Ai and Kazama thought it was a phase, something that would die down in a week or two.
But it didn’t.
Day after day, Shin was the first one out of the apartment. He didn’t even need an alarm. His body had adjusted to this new rhythm—wake up, get ready, rush to Professor Hawthorne’s office, spend hours researching, attend classes (or sometimes skip them to do more research), come home late, and then stay up thinking about the problem.
It was obsessive.
Ai found him one night, sitting on the couch with a notebook, scribbling equations at 3 AM under the dim light of the kitchen.
“Shin… go to sleep.”
“Can’t,” he muttered, chewing on the end of his pen. His hair was a mess, his eyes sharp and focused. “I think I’m onto something.”
Ai sighed, rubbing her temples. “At this rate, you’re gonna turn into some crazy math professor before you even graduate.”
Shin just grinned. “That’s not such a bad life, you know?”
Kazama, too, had given up on trying to make him rest. The madness had fully consumed him.
But just when Shin thought he was getting somewhere… a new storm arrived.

The Rival
It was another morning at Hawthorne’s office.
Shin had just entered, already thinking about where to pick up from yesterday, when he noticed someone else sitting in his usual spot.
A guy.
Tall, lean, sharp features, glasses perched on his nose, flipping through pages of research like he owned the place. He had an air of confidence, the kind that came from knowing he was the smartest guy in the room.
Shin instantly didn’t like him.
The guy glanced up, pushing up his glasses with one finger. His eyes narrowed the moment they met Shin’s.
“Huh. So, you’re the first-year causing all the noise.”
Shin blinked. “Who the hell are you?”
The guy smirked. “I’m Lawrence Adler. Third-year. Hawthorne’s best student.”
Shin stared. “Never heard of you.”
Lawrence chuckled, closing his book. “You will. Because starting today, I’m making sure you don’t get comfortable here.”
Shin raised an eyebrow. So, this was a challenge?
Fine. He was getting bored anyway.

Chapter 248: The Intellectual Showdown
The moment Lawrence Adler declared his presence, the entire atmosphere in Professor Hawthorne’s office shifted.
Shin didn’t need to be told twice—this guy wasn’t just some random senior. He was Hawthorne’s best student, meaning he had already spent years doing what Shin had just started. Experienced, confident, and incredibly arrogant.
And Shin immediately didn’t like him.
“You know,” Lawrence leaned back in his chair, arms crossed, eyes scrutinizing Shin like a specimen under a microscope. “It’s actually quite funny.”
Shin raised an eyebrow. “What is?”
“That Hawthorne wasted his time on some first-year dropout candidate.”
Shin blinked, then let out a slow whistle.
“Well, damn. You went straight for the throat.”
Lawrence smirked. “Just stating facts.”
Shin yawned, stretching. “Okay, genius, enlighten me. What exactly makes me a dropout candidate?”
Lawrence adjusted his glasses. “You’re undisciplined. You skip classes. You have no real foundation in advanced mathematical physics. You were given an unsolvable problem and, instead of understanding your limits, you’ve been wasting time chasing an answer that doesn’t exist.”
Shin stared at him, then scratched his cheek. “Wow. That’s a lot of words just to say you’re scared of me.”
Lawrence visibly twitched.
Professor Hawthorne, who had been silently sipping his coffee, smirked behind his mug.
“Oh? So that’s how you see it?” Lawrence scoffed. “You think I feel threatened?”
Shin shrugged. “I mean, yeah. Why else would you be trying so hard to put me down? If I were actually no threat, you wouldn’t bother.”
Lawrence’s smirk faltered for half a second.
Hawthorne chuckled.
“Well, well,” the professor said, leaning forward. “Since you two have so much to say, why don’t we put this to the test?”
Lawrence’s gaze sharpened. Shin grinned.
This was about to get interesting.

The Debate Begins
Professor Hawthorne stood up and wrote a single equation on the board.
A complex, multi-variable, nightmare of a problem.
“I assume you both know what this is?” he asked.
Shin tilted his head. “A nonlinear partial differential equation governing the motion of viscous fluid substances?”
Lawrence smirked. “Navier-Stokes.”
“Correct,” Hawthorne nodded. “Now, humor me—which of you can better argue why this equation remains unsolved?”
Shin instantly perked up.
“Oh, this is gonna be fun.”

The Intellectual Clash
Lawrence went first.
He spoke with precision, articulating his arguments in a structured, almost mechanical way.
"The fundamental challenge lies in proving whether a smooth and globally defined solution exists for all initial conditions. The current computational methods struggle with the chaotic nature of turbulence, which remains the primary barrier to analytical resolution. The issue isn't just a mathematical one—it's a physical one, rooted in the fundamental unpredictability of fluid motion at different scales."
Shin was unimpressed.
“Okay, cool.” He cracked his knuckles. “My turn.”
Leaning forward, he didn’t even glance at the board.
"Navier-Stokes isn’t just a math problem. It’s a war between certainty and chaos. You’re talking about it like it’s just numbers on a page, but in reality, this equation controls everything from how blood flows in our veins to how hurricanes form. The reason we can’t solve it? It’s not about computation or turbulence—it’s about the fact that the universe doesn’t like being predicted. Chaos theory is a thing for a reason, y’know?"
Lawrence narrowed his eyes. “That’s an oversimplification.”
Shin grinned. “And yours was an overcomplication.”
“You’re ignoring the mathematical approach—”
“And you’re ignoring the human approach,” Shin cut in. “Real-world application matters, dude. You can throw as many theoretical justifications at me as you want, but at the end of the day, if you can’t make it work for something practical, it’s useless.”
Lawrence scoffed. “So, what? You think the solution is just feeling the equation out?”
Shin smirked. “Hey, you’d be surprised how much you can figure out by just vibing with the math.”
Silence.
Professor Hawthorne was grinning like a madman.
Lawrence exhaled through his nose. “You’re impossible.”
Shin beamed. “Thanks, I try.”

Aftermath
Once the argument ended, Shin expected Lawrence to hate him.
But instead…
Lawrence sighed, rubbing his temples. “You’re annoying.”
Shin grinned. “You’re stuck with me now, aren’t you?”
“…Unfortunately.”
Hawthorne chuckled. This was going to be fun.

Chapter 249: The Frustration of Shin Nohara
Ai and Kazama walked into the bustling campus cafeteria, trays in hand, scanning the room for their usual spot. It didn’t take them long to find Shin—he was hard to miss, even in a crowd.
But something was off.
Instead of his usual laid-back grin or his lazy, amused expression, Shin was sitting at their table, hunched over, violently stabbing his fork into his food.
Kazama blinked. “Uh… what the hell are you doing?”
“Practicing fluid dynamics,” Shin muttered darkly, stabbing his mashed potatoes again. “If I keep at it, maybe I can finally understand why the universe is a little bitch.”
Ai and Kazama exchanged a glance.
Kazama sat down across from him, setting his coffee down carefully. “Alright. What happened?”
Shin exhaled heavily and dragged his hand down his face. “It’s this goddamn equation. Navier-Stokes.”
Ai furrowed her brows. “Wait, isn’t that the impossible math problem Hawthorne gave you?”
“The one no one has solved for over a century?” Kazama added.
Shin slammed his fork down.
“YES, THANK YOU, KAZAMA, I KNOW.”
Ai sipped her drink. “So, you couldn’t solve it?”
Shin gave her a deadpan look. “Of course I couldn’t solve it. No one can solve it.”
Kazama smirked. “And yet, you thought you could?”
Shin groaned, running a hand through his hair. “See, this is why I’m mad! I don’t know if I can or not! I’ve been staring at this thing for DAYS, and it’s so close to making sense, but then—BAM—it turns into a goddamn fever dream!”
Kazama tilted his head. “You’re frustrated because you’re actually trying for once and not instantly succeeding.”
Shin shot him a glare. “I will throw this entire plate at you.”
Ai tapped her fingers on the table. “You’re cute when you’re mad.”
Shin groaned and buried his face in his hands. “I hate everything.”
Kazama grinned. “I’m enjoying this.”
Ai giggled.
The campus cafeteria continued bustling around them, but at their table, a new challenge had begun.
Shin Nohara had finally found something he couldn’t just breeze through.
And he was losing his mind over it.

Chapter 250: Balancing Acts and New Beginnings
The Clubs Begin
Life at university had truly begun to take shape.
Between lectures, assignments, and the ever-looming Navier-Stokes Problem that had turned Shin into a caffeine-dependent insomniac, the trio had also started participating in various extracurriculars.
Ai had naturally secured a position in the Business and Finance Club, immediately making connections with influential seniors and professors. Within a few weeks, she was already part of a student-led investment project that worked with real-world financial simulations.
Kazama had joined a competitive business strategy group, where he worked on case studies that mimicked real corporate problems. His sharp mind and strategic thinking made him stand out, and before long, he was already getting noticed by the seniors.
And Shin?
Well, Shin had joined nothing.
Unless sitting in Professor Hawthorne’s office and mentally waging war with one of the world’s greatest unsolved equations counted as a club.
"Go Touch Grass, Shin."
One afternoon, as Ai and Kazama were organizing their assignments, Ai sighed and finally decided enough was enough.
She turned to Shin, who was sitting on the couch, a pen in his mouth, his laptop open, and his eyes dark and sunken from lack of sleep. He was wearing the same hoodie from three days ago.
Ai closed her laptop with a thud. “Shin.”
No response.
She crossed her arms. “Shin.”
Still nothing.
Kazama sighed and reached over, snapping his fingers in front of Shin’s face. “Oi.”
Shin blinked, slowly turning his head like a haunted mannequin. “Hmm?”
Ai grabbed his laptop and held it hostage.
Shin gasped. “Hey! My child!”
Ai narrowed her eyes. “Shin. When was the last time you left campus for something fun?”
Shin stared at her. “Uh… we got groceries two days ago?”
Kazama facepalmed. “That’s not fun, Shin. That’s survival.”
Ai sighed. “Look, I get it. You’re obsessed with solving this problem. But you need a break.” She tapped the laptop. “You’re clearly stuck. What do you do when a strategy isn’t working?”
Shin frowned. “Try another strategy?”
Ai nodded. “Exactly. And right now, your strategy of becoming one with the problem is failing. So, do something else for a while. Refresh your brain.”
Shin leaned back on the couch. “Like what?”
Ai smiled. “Like Kendo.”
Shin immediately sat up. “No.”
Kazama raised an eyebrow. “That was fast.”
Ai pressed on. “Come on, Shin. You used to love Kendo.”
Shin scoffed. “Yeah, and then I quit.”
Ai tilted her head. “And now, maybe you should start again.”
Shin groaned. “I dunno, Ai… I don’t do well with organized sports.”
Ai smirked. “No, you don’t do well with listening to authority. Which, by the way, is exactly what Hawthorne is making you do.”
Shin narrowed his eyes. “I don’t like how right you are.”
Ai handed him back his laptop. “Just try it once. If you hate it, you never have to go again.”
Shin sighed, rubbing his face.
“…Fine.”
Kazama smirked. “Wow, Ai, you’re really good at handling your man.”
Shin and Ai both turned to glare at him.
Kazama shrugged. “Just saying.”
Assignments, Projects, and Overwhelming Workloads
University wasn’t just about clubs and Kendo, though.
Their workload had skyrocketed.
Ai had multiple group projects, with team members who ranged from brilliant to completely useless.


Kazama was knee-deep in business case studies, pulling all-nighters to finish reports.


Shin had an increasing pile of mathematical and physics-related assignments, on top of the research work Hawthorne had forced onto him.


One night, at 2 AM, all three of them were in the living room, laptops open, looking half-dead.
Ai groaned, slamming her head onto the table. “Why… are there… so many reports…?”
Kazama didn’t even look up. “Welcome to higher education.”
Shin stared blankly at his screen. “This university really hates its students, huh?”
Ai sighed dramatically. “I miss high school. We were dumb, but at least we had fun.”
Kazama snorted. “Speak for yourself. I was dumb and suffering.”
Shin yawned. “I think I should just drop out and become a farmer.”
Kazama smirked. “You? Wake up early and work hard? I’d pay to see that.”
Shin narrowed his eyes. “You have no faith in me.”
“I have realistic expectations.”
Ai sighed. “You two are idiots.”
But even in the middle of the stress, this was university life.
And despite the chaos, they wouldn’t have it any other way.

Chapter 251: Progress, Rivalries, and the Never-Ending Chase for Knowledge
Small Steps, Big Progress
University life was settling into a rhythm.
Despite the initial chaos, each of them had begun making real strides in their respective fields.
Ai: The Rising Star of Business Analytics
Ai had quickly become a standout in her courses.
Her group projects were always among the best in the class, thanks to her sharp decision-making and natural leadership.


She had started networking aggressively, connecting with professors, guest lecturers, and even corporate executives who visited for seminars.


Her finance professor had personally recommended her for an elite student-run investment group, where she handled real money in stock market simulations.


During one of her finance discussions, a senior had casually remarked, "You could honestly be running an actual hedge fund someday."
Ai had simply smirked.
"That’s the plan."
Kazama: Climbing the Business Ladder
Kazama, meanwhile, was taking the business world by storm in his own way.
He had aced multiple case study competitions, beating out second and third-year students with his strategic thinking.


His analytical approach to corporate decision-making and market analysis had caught the attention of a professor, who invited him to assist on a real-world consulting project.


The consulting work put him in direct competition with MBA students, forcing him to sharpen his abilities faster than he ever imagined.


One day, a third-year business major scoffed at him, saying, "First-years don’t belong in these projects."
Kazama had simply adjusted his collar and presented a flawless business strategy that shut everyone up.
He wasn’t here to play games.
Shin: The Reluctant Genius vs. the Unsolvable Problem
Shin was deep in a world of chaos.
Ever since Professor Hawthorne had dragged him into research, his life had turned into an endless cycle of frustration and breakthroughs.
But it wasn’t just the Navier-Stokes Problem anymore.
The professor had given him multiple side projects, testing his abilities in different areas of applied mathematics and physics:
Fluid dynamics simulations – Shin had to create models for air and water movement.


Quantum probability problems – Just for fun. (Hawthorne was sadistic like that.)


Chaos theory experiments – Shin’s personal favorite, since it felt as unpredictable as his own life.


And of course, there was Lawrence.
Shin vs. Lawrence: The Intellectual Rivalry Intensifies
Lawrence was Professor Hawthorne’s top student.
He was everything Shin hated in a person—smug, arrogant, and insanely smart.
The two of them argued every single time they were in the same room.


Lawrence was constantly trying to one-up Shin, treating him like a newbie who didn’t deserve to be there.


Their "debates" had gotten so heated that Professor Hawthorne had to separate them once.


One day, while working on a complex turbulence equation, Lawrence leaned over Shin’s shoulder and smirked.
"That’s wrong."
Shin didn’t even look up. "No, it’s not."
"Yes, it is."
"No, it’s not."
Lawrence rolled his eyes. "If you’re so confident, then bet on it."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "What’s the bet?"
Lawrence grinned. "Loser buys coffee for the entire semester."
Shin immediately regretted his confidence.
But two days later, he walked into the lab, dropped his flawless solution onto the table, and smirked at Lawrence.
"I take my coffee black."
Professor Hawthorne simply laughed.
Kendo, A Break from the Madness
Despite his deep dive into research, Shin had actually started attending Kendo again.
At first, he had reluctantly stepped into the dojo, feeling like a stranger in his own sport.
But the moment he held a shinai (bamboo sword) in his hands again, something clicked.
He wasn’t just good—he was scary good.
Within weeks, he was already being pushed into high-level sparring matches.
One of the seniors had jokingly asked, "Were you in the national team or something?"
Shin had just laughed it off.
"Something like that."
The Balance Between Madness and Life
Every night, the three of them gathered in their apartment, exhausted but somehow fulfilled.
Shin, still in his gym clothes after Kendo, was furiously scribbling equations in his notebook.
Ai was updating her financial reports, her glasses slipping down her nose.
Kazama was reading a corporate strategy book, half-asleep.
Ai sighed, closing her laptop. "We really are insane, aren’t we?"
Kazama chuckled. "We’ve always been insane. University just gave us a reason to be."
Shin grinned, leaning back in his chair.
"Then let’s keep going."

Chapter 252: A Step Toward the Impossible
One Year Later...
Time had flown by in an instant.
Shin had gone through hell in the past year, juggling classes, research, and Kendo while somehow keeping up with Kazama and Ai’s achievements in their own fields. But one thing had remained unchanged—the Navier-Stokes Problem.
For months, he had tried everything—brute force calculations, theoretical reimaginings, even desperate caffeine-fueled scribbling sessions at 3 AM.
Nothing worked.
But then... something changed.
The Moment of Inspiration
It happened on a completely normal evening.
Shin was half-asleep on his desk, his notebook covered in chaotic equations, rejected proofs, and barely legible notes. His mind had long since melted from overthinking the same problem over and over again.
But as he stared at his work, something clicked.
A pattern. A structure hidden in the chaos.
Like a missing puzzle piece that had been in front of him the entire time.
His eyes widened. His heartbeat spiked.
He scrambled for a pen, rewriting the equation from scratch, applying the new insight.
He held his breath.
The numbers aligned. Perfectly.
"No way..."
He redid the calculation. Again. And again.
Each time, it worked.
Something in him snapped.
He jumped up, knocking his chair over. "HOLY SH—"
His shouting woke up Ai and Kazama, who rushed in half-panicked.
"Shin?! What happened?!" Ai yelled.
"Did you set something on fire?!" Kazama demanded.
Shin just stood there, staring at them like he had seen God.
"I think I just... I THINK I JUST SOLVED IT."
The Shockwave Begins
The next morning, Professor Hawthorne nearly choked on his coffee.
Shin had barged into his office, slammed the notebook onto his desk, and stood there, waiting.
Hawthorne frowned, flipping through the pages.
Then his eyes narrowed. His reading slowed.
Then, he froze.
A long, heavy silence filled the room.
Then the professor slowly looked up.
"Nohara."
Shin swallowed. "Yeah?"
Hawthorne exhaled. "Get ready. This is about to get very, very big."
University-Wide Chaos
By the end of the week, everyone in the science and mathematics departments had heard.
Shin had made actual progress on an unsolvable problem.
Professors who had barely spoken to Shin before were suddenly inviting him to discussions.


Researchers were arguing over the validity of his work before they even fully understood it.


Graduate students swarmed the library, trying to get their hands on his notes.


Even Lawrence, his usual smug rival, had nothing to say—just a long stare and a quiet, “You’re actually insane.”
And then...
The Shock Spreads to the Math World
Within weeks, Shin’s proof-in-progress had reached outside the university.
It wasn’t a full solution—not yet. But it was a breakthrough.
One that mathematicians around the world couldn’t ignore.
Emails flooded in. Conference invitations. Interview requests.
Some people doubted him. Others dismissed it as a fluke.
But those who actually read his work?
They were speechless.
Shin Nohara Had Just Changed the Game.
And he wasn’t even done yet.

Chapter 253: The Press Conference
The buzz had reached unimaginable levels.
Stanford University, recognizing the magnitude of Shin's breakthrough, had organized a full-scale press conference—a rare event for an undergraduate student. But Shin wasn't just any student anymore. His work had sent shockwaves through the mathematics and physics world, forcing even tenured professors and world-renowned researchers to take notice.
And now, the world wanted to see him.
The Setup
The event was held in one of the university’s grand halls, the kind reserved for Nobel laureates or groundbreaking discoveries.
Rows of reporters, academic scholars, and students filled the room. Cameras were set up, broadcasting the event live to scientific communities worldwide.
Behind the long wooden table, seated under the blinding lights of the cameras, sat Shin Nohara, Professor Hawthorne, and a panel of Stanford’s top mathematicians.
Shin, for once in his life, was speechless.
"The hell am I doing here?" he muttered under his breath.
Ai and Kazama, seated in the audience, barely held in their laughter.
"You look like you just saw a ghost," Kazama whispered.
"I AM THE GHOST," Shin whispered back.
A university representative stepped forward, microphone in hand.
"Thank you all for joining us today. We are here to discuss an extraordinary development in mathematical physics. The work of undergraduate student Shin Nohara has made significant progress on one of the most famous unsolved problems in the world—the Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness problem."
A wave of murmurs and excited whispers filled the room. The cameras zoomed in on Shin, who sat there half-stunned, half-regretting all his life choices.
Hawthorne nudged him.
"Don’t look like you got dragged here against your will."
"I DID."
The Questions Begin
A journalist from The New York Times raised his hand.
"Mr. Nohara, how did you approach a problem that has remained unsolved for centuries?"
Shin leaned toward the mic, clearing his throat.
"Well... I didn't know it was impossible, so I tried anyway."
The room fell silent.
Then a burst of laughter and shocked murmurs erupted.
"Classic," Ai whispered, shaking her head.
The next question came from an MIT professor.
"Your work challenges many established mathematical frameworks. Are you confident in its validity?"
Shin sat up straight.
"I don’t believe in confidence. I believe in math. If the numbers hold up, they hold up."
More murmurs.
Reporters jotted down notes furiously. Some of the professors on the panel actually nodded in agreement.
The Unexpected Turn
Then, a journalist from a major physics journal leaned forward.
"Shin, do you think you’ll be the one to fully solve Navier-Stokes?"
The room fell into a deep silence.
All eyes were on him.
Shin exhaled, thinking carefully.
Then he smirked.
"I don’t know. But if I don’t, I’ll just make sure I’m the reason someone else does."
A stunned pause.
Then—applause.
The Aftermath
The press conference exploded online within hours.
Clips of Shin’s answers went viral in scientific circles, social media, and news platforms. His name was now being mentioned in the same sentence as some of the greatest mathematical minds.
Stanford’s mathematics department had just gained worldwide attention, and Shin, whether he liked it or not, had become a rising name in theoretical physics and mathematics.
But this was just the beginning.
Because now, with the whole world watching...
Shin had no choice but to finish what he started.

It was a rare quiet evening in their shared apartment.
Shin was lying on the couch, staring at the ceiling, utterly exhausted from all the chaos that had followed the press conference. Ai was sitting next to him, flipping through her economics textbook, while Kazama scrolled through emails from his professors.
That’s when Shin’s phone buzzed.
"Hima-chan?" he mumbled, seeing his sister’s name pop up.
He sat up and answered.
"Onii-chan!" came Hima’s excited voice.
"Yo, what’s up, squirt?" Shin grinned, stretching.
"I have news!" she declared proudly.
"What? You finally stopped terrorizing Mom and Dad?"
"I’m serious!" she huffed. "I’ve decided—I’m applying to study abroad!"
Shin blinked.
Kazama and Ai, overhearing the conversation, looked up curiously.
"Abroad?" Shin repeated.
"Yup! Seeing you do all these crazy things over there, I thought… why not me too? I want to study somewhere new, experience the world!"
Shin ran a hand through his hair.
"You sure? It’s not easy, you know."
"Duh, I know! But I wanna do something big too! And honestly… after seeing you in the news, I just thought—why not aim high?"
Shin felt a strange mix of emotions—pride, surprise, and the sudden realization that his little sister wasn’t so little anymore.
"What are you thinking of studying?"
"Hmmm… I’m still deciding, but I’m leaning towards international law or political science!"
"Wow, a future world leader," Shin chuckled. "I’m doomed."
Hima laughed.
"Anyway! I just wanted to tell you first. I’ll keep you updated! Also, tell Ai-chan and Kazama-nii I said hi!"
"Will do, squirt."
As the call ended, Shin put his phone down, exhaling.
Ai raised an eyebrow.
"So? What’s up with Hima?"
"She’s applying for universities abroad," Shin said, still processing it.
Kazama smirked.
"Looks like you inspired her."
Shin groaned, flopping back onto the couch.
"Great. Now I actually have to act like a responsible older brother."
Ai giggled.
"You’ll do just fine."
But deep down, Shin couldn't help but feel a little emotional.
His baby sister was growing up fast.
And soon, she might be joining him halfway across the world.

Chapter 270: The Next Chapter Begins
Time had a way of slipping past, unnoticed in the whirlwind of ambitions, challenges, and fleeting moments of youth.
Four years had passed.
The grand hall of Stanford University was packed with graduating students, their families, and esteemed faculty. The air buzzed with excitement, mixed with the bittersweet realization that this chapter of life had come to an end.
Shin stood tall in his graduation gown, his tassel hanging over his cap. His expression was the same as ever—a little lazy, a little amused, but strangely satisfied.
Beside him, Ai adjusted her own gown, looking more elegant than ever. Kazama, ever the perfectionist, stood with his diploma in hand, already thinking about the next step.
"Man, four years gone just like that," Shin mused, staring at the sea of people around them.
"You make it sound like we just blinked through it," Kazama scoffed.
"Didn't we, though?" Ai smiled. "Feels like just yesterday we stepped off that plane."
Kazama smirked. "And now, look at us. Fully-fledged adults stepping into the real world."
Their paths, though intertwined, were about to diverge.
Kazama had landed a job at one of the biggest multinational corporations in the world, his strategic mind and business acumen making him a prime candidate for corporate leadership.
Ai, on the other hand, had decided to take up a key role in her father’s business, managing its U.S. operations. Despite offers from top firms, she had made up her mind—she would help expand her family’s empire.
And then there was Shin.
Unlike the two, he wasn’t joining the workforce. His journey wasn’t over yet.
While his peers were settling into careers, Shin had chosen to continue his education, diving even deeper into the mysteries of mathematics and physics.
He had been offered a full scholarship for his Master’s program, with his research on Navier-Stokes making waves in the academic community. Professor Hawthorne had personally requested that he stay on as his research partner.
"So," Kazama said, adjusting his glasses. "This is it, huh? The real world begins."
"Not for me," Shin grinned. "I’m still a student."
Ai rolled her eyes. "Shin being a ‘forever student’ is the least surprising thing ever."
"Hey, I’m not just studying," Shin defended. "I’m making history."
Kazama snorted. "You mean you’re going to continue driving Professor Hawthorne insane for the next few years?"
"That too."
Laughter rang between them, but there was an unspoken understanding.
This wasn’t goodbye.
Their paths were different, but their bond remained unshaken.
A new chapter had begun.
And the world was waiting.

Chapter 271: New Beginnings, Same Chaos
Time moved forward, and life continued to evolve in ways none of them had fully anticipated.
It had been two years since Hima arrived in the U.S. to pursue her degree at Harvard Law School—a prestigious path that had surprised even her own family.
And in those two years, a few things had changed.
Kazama & Hima: An Unlikely Roommate Situation
Kazama, ever the methodical and responsible one, had initially helped Hima settle into life in the U.S. when she arrived.
What started as simple guidance turned into something neither of them expected—they became roommates.
At first, Kazama thought it was just temporary, but soon enough, the idea of living alone again felt oddly unappealing.
Hima, now in her second year at Harvard Law, had turned into a force of nature—balancing her studies, part-time internships, and still managing to tease Kazama at every opportunity.
"So, how does it feel living with a legal genius?" Hima smirked, leaning back on the couch.
Kazama sighed, sipping his coffee. "It feels like living with an unpaid lawyer who somehow finds loopholes in every argument."
"That’s because I am one."
"That’s because you are annoying."
She laughed, but truth be told, they had settled into a comfortable rhythm.
Kazama, now an established figure in the corporate world, worked long hours, but coming home to someone who matched his sharp wit and challenged his thinking made it… bearable.
Even if she stole his coffee every morning.
Shin & Ai: Living Together… Somehow
Meanwhile, over in Stanford, Shin and Ai had made another decision that shocked absolutely no one—
They moved in together.
At first, it was simply for convenience.
Ai’s family had offered her a high-end apartment close to her office, and Shin—being fully engrossed in his research—saw no point in renting a separate place.
"It’s purely practical," Ai had said.
"Of course," Shin had agreed.
And yet, somehow, their daily life felt suspiciously like a married couple’s routine.
Ai would wake up early, go for a jog, then get ready for work.
Shin would wake up late, barely remember to eat, and get lost in his research for hours.
Ai would drag him out for meals, make sure he didn’t live like a caveman, and occasionally lecture him about responsibilities.
And at the end of the day, he would pull her onto the couch, and they’d just sit in silence, enjoying each other’s presence.
"We’re disgustingly domestic," Ai admitted one evening, watching as Shin attempted (and failed) to cook.
"Nah," Shin shrugged. "We’re just two people who happen to live together and love each other."
Ai blinked, before sighing. "You can’t just say stuff like that so casually."
Shin smirked. "Why not? You kissed me first at the wedding, remember?"
"I will throw this pan at you."
As time passed, their lives became a strange, beautiful mess—filled with teasing, quiet moments, and an undeniable warmth.
Even if Shin forgot to do laundry half the time.
A New Normal
The four of them—Kazama, Hima, Ai, and Shin—had found their own paths, but somehow, they were all still connected.
Living in different cities.
 Chasing different goals.
 But still bound together in ways that went beyond distance.
And as they continued forward, one thing was certain—
Life was just getting started.
To be continued…

shin made more progressn the problem with his mentor in his 3 years masters journey, completing his master in computational physics and mathematics with his mentor. after which he decided to become a researcher at stanford but for that he had to also become a professor there. shin is now a professor!?
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 272: Professor Nohara?!
Three years had passed since Shin decided to pursue his Master’s in Computational Physics and Mathematics at Stanford.
Three years of grueling research, sleepless nights, and heated intellectual battles with his mentor, Professor Hawthorne.
Three years of chasing the impossible—the Navier-Stokes Problem.
And now, standing at the very end of that journey, Shin Nohara had achieved something unbelievable.
He had officially completed his Master’s degree.
But his journey didn’t end there.
Stanford’s Offer: Researcher… and Professor?
After everything, Shin had made the decision that shocked even himself—
He wanted to stay at Stanford as a researcher.
But there was a catch.
To become a full-time researcher at Stanford, he needed to also take on the role of a professor.
At first, he laughed at the idea.
"Me? A professor? Teaching? You sure you’re not joking, Hawthorne?"
Professor Hawthorne gave him a dry stare. "With the amount of time you’ve spent at this university, you might as well start collecting a pension plan."
"That’s not an answer—"
"Stanford wants you, Shin. The world wants you. You’ve made incredible progress on the problem, and you have a mind that could change the field forever. But if you want to stay here, you need to take on the professor role as well. It’s part of the deal."
Shin fell silent.
The thought of teaching felt foreign to him. He was never the type to care about “academic authority” or “traditional education.”
But then again…
It wasn’t just about teaching.
It was about having the freedom to continue his research.
It was about pushing the boundaries of mathematics and physics.
It was about staying at the place that had become his second home.
So, with a deep sigh, he finally gave his answer—
"Fine. But if I’m going to be a professor, I’m doing it my way."
Hawthorne smirked. "Wouldn’t expect anything less."
Professor Nohara’s First Day
The news spread fast—
Shin Nohara, the rising star of computational physics and mathematics, was now a professor at Stanford.
The reactions were hilarious.
Kazama nearly choked on his coffee.


Ai sighed, as if she had already accepted the absurdity of her boyfriend’s life.


Hima laughed for a full five minutes, sending him endless texts like “Who would’ve thought my idiot brother would be a professor before I even finished law school?”


And then, there was the Stanford student body.
Nobody knew what to expect from Professor Nohara.
Until the first lecture.
The classroom was packed. Not just with his students, but also curious outsiders who wanted to see what the hype was about.
Then, Shin walked in—
Wearing a hoodie, jeans, and sneakers.
With a coffee cup in one hand and zero textbooks in the other.
And his first words as a professor?
"Alright, let’s get one thing straight—" He leaned against the desk, taking a sip of coffee. "I don’t care about attendance, I don’t care about grades, and I definitely don’t care about sucking up to professors."
The entire room went silent.
A few students exchanged glances, some intrigued, others shocked.
"The only thing I care about is whether you actually understand what we’re doing here."
He turned to the board and without looking, started writing complex equations at lightning speed.
Gasps filled the room.
"If you’re here for an easy A, leave now. If you’re here because you love this stuff, then welcome. Let’s have some fun."
The students didn’t move.
Instead, something unexpected happened.
A slow clap started from the back of the room.
Then another.
And then—
The entire class erupted in applause.
Shin Nohara wasn’t just a professor.
He was already a legend.
And this was just the beginning.

Chapter 273: The Best Professor Any Kid Could Ask For
Word spread across Stanford like wildfire—
Professor Shin Nohara wasn’t just a genius.
 He was the coolest professor anyone had ever seen.
Within a week, his lectures were always full, students from other departments sneaking in just to experience his teaching.
Within a month, he had an underground fan club.
Within a semester, students were already saying:
"This guy makes math actually fun."
 "I don’t even like physics, but I love his class."
 "He explains things like he’s just talking to a friend over coffee."
 "He roasted a textbook once and called it ‘academically useless.’"
Shin, of course, didn’t care about the hype.
He just wanted to teach the way he wanted—no unnecessary rules, no suffocating formalities, and definitely no dull, outdated methods.
And his teaching style?
He’d start every class with a joke. (“If physics was a person, it would be that one friend who overcomplicates everything.”)


Instead of just writing equations, he’d tell stories behind the math, making every concept alive.


He never used slides—he’d just pace around, scribbling equations at breakneck speed while casually throwing in pop culture references.


If a student asked a dumb question? He answered like it was the most important question ever.


If a student looked confused? He’d stop everything and find a new way to explain it until they got it.


His students loved him.
But the real proof of his impact came when one student, who had been failing math his entire life, walked up to him after class and said—
"Professor Nohara, I think I finally get it. And for the first time… I actually like math."
Shin just smirked, ruffling the kid’s hair. "Took you long enough."
The Professor Who Broke All the Rules
Of course, not everyone at Stanford was thrilled with him.
Some of the old-school professors saw him as “too unconventional.”
"He lets students call him by his first name!"
 "He doesn’t even take attendance!"
 "He makes fun of textbooks!"
But Shin didn’t care.
Because at the end of the day, his students were learning.
And not just learning—but actually loving it.
One day, a high-ranking professor confronted him—
"You can’t just ignore academic traditions, Nohara."
Shin grinned. "Why not? It’s working, isn’t it?"
The professor scowled. "This is Stanford, not some high school club."
Shin just shrugged. "Then maybe Stanford should start acting like a place where students actually enjoy learning."
And just like that, Shin Nohara continued being the best professor any kid could ask for.
And he wasn’t stopping anytime soon.

Chapter 274: The Ultimate Decision
Shin leaned back in the leather chair across from Professor Hawthorne, the man who had once tried to humble him with an “impossible” problem.
Now, after years of relentless work, Shin was the one sitting in this office, not as a student—but as a fellow professor.
And today, he was about to make the biggest decision of his career.
Hawthorne peered over his glasses. "You’ve been quiet, Nohara. That’s rare. What’s on your mind?"
Shin tapped his fingers on the desk, exhaling. "I’ve decided."
Hawthorne raised an eyebrow. "Decided what?"
Shin leaned forward, locking eyes with his mentor. "My PhD research. I’m going to solve the Navier-Stokes problem."
Silence.
Hawthorne’s expression didn’t change. He simply stared, as if waiting for Shin to take back his words.
But Shin didn’t.
Instead, he smirked. "You’re not saying anything, old man. That bad of a choice?"
Hawthorne finally leaned back, rubbing his temples. "You really are a reckless bastard, Nohara."
Shin just laughed. "Well, I learned from the best."
Hawthorne sighed. "You realize what you’re saying, don’t you? Mathematicians have spent centuries trying to crack this. It’s not just about skill—it’s about whether a solution even exists in the first place."
"I know."
"And you’re still choosing this? As your PhD research? Not just another project, but the defining problem of your academic career?"
Shin’s eyes sharpened, his smirk fading.
"Yes. I’ve made up my mind."
For the first time in a long time, Hawthorne looked genuinely surprised.
He had seen Shin excel, seen him break norms, seen him laugh at problems that made others cry—but this? This wasn’t just another challenge.
This was one of the hardest problems in modern mathematics and physics.
And Shin Nohara was saying he was going to solve it.
Hawthorne shook his head, sighing. "You insane kid."
Then, he chuckled.
"Fine. If you’re going to be reckless, you might as well have me around to keep you from completely losing your mind."
Shin grinned. "So that’s a yes?"
Hawthorne smirked. "It’s a ‘let’s see if you can survive this first, then we’ll talk.’"
Shin just stood up, stretching. "That’s good enough for me."
And just like that—
The greatest mathematical battle of his life had begun.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 275: A New Chapter Begins
The sun had long set, but Shin’s office at Stanford was still brightly lit. Papers were scattered across his desk—mathematical equations, computational models, fluid dynamics theories—all focused on solving Navier-Stokes.
For months, his world had revolved around research.
But tonight, something else was on his mind.
Something that had nothing to do with mathematics.
He grabbed his phone and dialed Kazama.
After a few rings, Kazama picked up. “Oi, Shin. What’s up? Still fighting with equations?”
Shin smirked. “Of course. But today, I have something bigger to deal with.”
"Oh? Bigger than the problem that’s been making mathematicians cry for decades?"
Shin exhaled. "I’m thinking of proposing to Ai."
Silence.
For the first time ever, Kazama was speechless.
"Wait… what?" Kazama’s voice finally came through. "You? Marriage? Are you serious?"
Shin chuckled. “Dead serious.”
Kazama sighed heavily. "Damn. I never thought I’d see the day.”
"You and me both."
Kazama was quiet for a moment before he spoke again, this time more serious. "You really love her, huh?"
Shin leaned back in his chair, a rare softness in his expression. "Yeah. I do."
"Then do it, idiot."
Shin grinned. "That’s the plan."
But before anything else, there was someone else he needed to talk to.
The next day, Shin made his way to Harvard Law School.
Hima was in the middle of studying in the library when he found her. She looked up, surprised to see him.
"Shin-nii? What are you doing here?"
He pulled up a chair, sitting across from her.
"I need your advice on something."
She raised an eyebrow. "Okay…?"
Shin scratched the back of his head, looking unusually serious. "I’m thinking of proposing to Ai."
Hima blinked.
Then, her entire face lit up.
"WHAAAAT?! YOU’RE ACTUALLY DOING IT?!" she almost yelled, earning glares from nearby students.
Shin shushed her. "Oi, keep it down! I don’t need the entire law school knowing before Ai does."
Hima giggled, covering her mouth. "I knew you’d marry her one day! This is huge, Shin-nii!"
He smirked. "So, any advice for your big brother?"
Hima tapped her chin. "Hmm… do you have a plan? A ring? A way to make it unforgettable?"
Shin leaned back. "That’s why I’m here. I need ideas."
Hima’s eyes sparkled. "Leave it to me! I’ll help you make this the most perfect proposal ever!"
Shin chuckled, shaking his head. "I had a feeling you’d say that."
And with that—
The plan for the proposal had begun.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 276: Mission: Proposal
Stanford’s autumn air was crisp as Shin, Kazama, and Hima gathered in a cozy café near campus.
Hima had dragged the two of them there, claiming it was the perfect “war room” for planning. She even brought a notebook labeled ‘Mission: Proposal’ in big, glittery letters.
Kazama stared at it with utter disappointment. “Really, Hima? Glitter?”
Hima smirked. “This is an important mission! It deserves some style.”
Shin, however, was more focused on his coffee, swirling it absentmindedly. "Alright, let’s get to it. I need a solid plan.”
Hima flipped open the notebook. "Okay! First things first—where do you wanna do it?"
Shin leaned back, thinking. "It has to be somewhere special. Something meaningful to us both."
Kazama rubbed his chin. "Well, you two have a lot of history… Japan, Stanford, your apartment, hell—even that fake wedding you had."
Hima gasped dramatically. "Oh my god, SHIN. What if you take her back to the church where you had the fake wedding? Full circle moment!"
Shin gave her a deadpan look. "You want me to propose to her in a place where we lied about getting married?"
Kazama chuckled. "That’d be insane. But also… kinda genius."
Shin sighed. "Next idea."
Hima pouted but moved on. "Okay, okay. How about somewhere romantic? A private dinner? A rooftop overlooking the city?"
Kazama smirked. "Or… hear me out… during a math lecture."
Shin glared. "Kazama, I swear—"
"Think about it!" Kazama grinned. "You write the proposal as a complex equation on the board. She solves it, and BOOM—'Will you marry me?’"
Hima burst out laughing. "That’s so nerdy! I love it!"
Shin shook his head. "Absolutely not."
Hima wiped a tear. "Okay, okay, serious suggestion—what about at the Stanford Observatory?"
Shin paused.
That…
That wasn’t bad.
Hima continued, seeing his reaction. "Think about it. The stars, the quiet atmosphere… it’s beautiful, it’s meaningful, and it’s a place where you can have a private moment."
Kazama nodded. "Not a bad idea. Plus, it fits you two. She loves meaningful things, and you, well… you’re basically a celestial object yourself at this point."
Shin sighed. "Fine. That works."
Hima grinned. "YES! Step one: Location? Done."
She scribbled it in the notebook.
"Now, onto step two—THE RING."
Kazama leaned forward. "You getting a classic diamond or something unique?"
Shin rubbed his chin. "Something unique. Ai isn’t the flashy type."
Hima clapped excitedly. "Ooooh, I can help pick!"
Kazama raised an eyebrow. "You sure you wanna trust Hima’s taste?"
"Hey!" she pouted. "I have impeccable taste, thank you very much!"
Shin smirked. "Fine. You two can help. But it has to be perfect."
Kazama chuckled. "No pressure, huh?"
Hima grinned. "We got this! Now, last thing—how are you gonna do it?"
Shin exhaled. "Simple. I just want it to be real. No theatrics. No grand speeches. Just… me and her."
Kazama nodded approvingly. "Yeah. That sounds like you."
Hima smiled. "Then let’s make it happen."
And just like that—
The proposal mission was officially in motion.

Chapter 277: The Proposal in Motion
With the plan in place, the next few weeks were filled with silent preparations. Shin had never felt this much anticipation before—not even when tackling unsolvable equations.
Hima took full control over the ring selection, making it her personal mission to find something that screamed Ai without being over-the-top.
Kazama, meanwhile, used his corporate connections to help Shin navigate the university bureaucracy and get special permission to use the Stanford Observatory for the proposal.
And Shin? He kept it simple yet precise.
The date was set.
The authorities were informed.
Everything was falling into place.
The Ring Hunt
"Alright, genius," Hima said, dragging Shin into a high-end jewelry store one afternoon. "Let’s find THE ring."
Shin sighed. "I don’t see why you need me here. Just pick something good."
Hima rolled her eyes. "Oh, no. You’re not getting off that easy. You’re picking it, and I’m making sure you don’t mess it up."
Shin looked at the endless rows of diamonds, sapphires, and custom designs. His head hurt.
"This is harder than solving the Navier-Stokes problem."
Hima smirked. "Yeah, well, ‘proposing to the love of your life’ should be harder than fluid dynamics."
Shin ignored her and focused on the rings.
Then, he saw it.
A simple yet elegant platinum band, with a small, beautifully cut sapphire in the center instead of a diamond.
It wasn’t flashy, but it was unique. Subtle. Just like Ai.
"That one." Shin pointed.
Hima gasped. "Damn, okay. You actually have taste."
The shop assistant smiled. "A wonderful choice. Would you like an engraving?"
Shin paused.
Then smirked.
"Yes."
He took a small card and scribbled down two words:
"For eternity."
Hima melted on the spot. "OH MY GOD, SHIN, YOU ROMANTIC BASTARD."
Shin ignored her, paying for the ring.
One step closer.
Kazama’s Mission: The Observatory
While Shin handled the ring, Kazama was pulling strings at Stanford.
"So you want the Observatory for a private event?" one of the administrators asked.
Kazama, in full corporate shark mode, nodded smoothly. "Yes. My friend is one of Stanford’s brightest minds, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. We’d like permission for just one night."
The administrator hesitated. "Normally, it’s used for academic purposes—"
"It is academic." Kazama interrupted, adjusting his tie. "The most important research of all—love."
The administrator blinked.
Then sighed.
"Fine. You have one hour. Don’t break anything."
Kazama smirked. "Wouldn’t dream of it."
He walked out, sending a quick text to Shin:
“Done. You owe me.”
Shin texted back:
“I already owed you nothing, so now it’s negative.”
Kazama rolled his eyes.
Everything was in motion.
The ring was ready.
The location was secured.
The day was set.
And soon…
Ai Suotome was about to get the shock of her life.

show how they elaborately manipulated her throughout the day so she end up with shin in the observatory.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 278: The Most Calculated Deception
If Ai had any idea that today was the day, she would have figured everything out instantly.
So, they couldn’t let her suspect a thing.
Shin, Kazama, and Hima had designed a master plan, as elaborate as a heist, where every moment was engineered to lead Ai exactly where they wanted—without her realizing.
And so, the game began.

Step 1: Keeping Ai Busy
Kazama took the first shift.
"Ai, I need you to come to my office today." Kazama said over the phone in the morning. "There’s a financial report disaster, and I trust no one but you."
Ai groaned. "Ugh, Kazama, it’s a Sunday."
"And business doesn’t stop on Sundays. You’re the only one who can help."
Flattery. Always worked on Ai.
"Fine." She sighed. "I’ll be there in an hour."
Kazama grinned. Hook, line, and sinker.
Now, Ai would be trapped in an endless cycle of “urgent” business problems at his office for the next several hours. Meanwhile—

Step 2: The Outfit Setup
Hima had the second shift.
"Ai, are you free tonight?" she texted while Ai was knee-deep in financial spreadsheets at Kazama’s company.
"I guess? Why?" Ai responded.
"We’re going out. Wear something nice."
"Why?"
"Because I said so."
Ai, too tired to argue, just sighed and replied:
"Fine."
Hima smirked. Mission accomplished.
Now, Ai would unknowingly dress up for the occasion, making the night perfectly special without even knowing why.

Step 3: The Emotional Setup
While Ai was still working, Shin sent her a text.
"I heard you had a long day. Want to grab some coffee later?"
Casual. Non-suspicious.
Ai, rubbing her temples, smiled a little.
"Yeah. That sounds nice."
She had no idea that this coffee plan didn’t exist.
Because the moment Ai left Kazama’s office and returned home—

Step 4: The Location Bait
Hima was waiting at her apartment.
"Ai! Change into something nice! We’re going somewhere fancy."
Ai groaned. "What is WITH everyone today?"
"No questions. Just change."
Ai sighed but obliged.
Now dressed beautifully, she followed Hima into a car…
…except instead of going to a restaurant, they drove towards Stanford.
"Hima?" Ai frowned. "Where exactly are we going?"
Hima, keeping a straight face, shrugged. "A surprise."
They arrived at Stanford’s Observatory.
A dark, quiet place where the sky stretched endlessly.
Ai stepped out, confused.
"Why are we—"
The Observatory doors opened.
A single beam of golden light illuminated the inside.
And there stood Shin.
Waiting for her.

Step 5: The Final Stage
Ai’s breath hitched.
"Shin…?"
Shin, dressed a little neater than usual, with that familiar lazy smirk, raised his hand.
"Come inside."
Ai slowly stepped forward, completely spellbound.
Inside the Observatory, the room was dimly lit. A telescope pointed up at the vast night sky, stars twinkling like they were watching this moment unfold.
Ai turned back to Hima—
But she was already gone.
The doors shut softly.
And Ai was alone with Shin.
She blinked. "What… is happening?"
Shin chuckled. "Take a guess."
Ai looked around. The romantic setting. The quiet ambiance. The way Shin’s eyes held something deeper tonight.
And suddenly, it hit her.
Her heart stopped.
"No way."
Shin reached into his pocket.
And pulled out the ring.
Ai’s hands flew to her mouth.
Tears instantly welled up.
Shin exhaled, then—for the first time in his life—his voice came out soft, but completely certain.
"Ai Suotome."
"You’ve been part of my life since we were kids."
"You followed me. Chased me. Annoyed me."
"And somewhere along the way, I started to feel like… I was always meant to stand next to you."
Ai let out a small laugh, choking on tears.
"Idiot."
Shin’s lips curled up.
"So, I figured…"
He dropped to one knee.
Ai’s world spun.
"I might as well make it official."
He opened the box.
Inside, the sapphire ring gleamed under the starlight.
And in small engraving—
“For eternity.”
Ai sucked in a breath.
Shin looked up at her, his face calm, but his eyes—his eyes had never been more intense.
"Ai."
"Will you marry me?"
The moment stood still.
The stars. The air. The world.
Then—
Ai laughed through her tears.
And tackled him to the floor.
"YES, YOU IDIOT."
And then—
She kissed him.
Not the teasing, playful kisses she always stole.
Not the mischievous ones full of schemes.
But a deep, genuine, heart-wrenching kiss that made Shin’s entire being melt.
The Observatory was silent, except for their breathing.
And when they finally pulled away, Ai’s forehead touched his.
"You really are the best, Shin Nohara."
Shin smirked. "I know."
And so—
A chapter in their lives closed.
And a new one began.

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 279: The Grand Preparation Begins
If Shin thought proposing was a huge operation, then planning the wedding was a full-scale war.
They weren’t just getting married.
They were orchestrating an international event.
And by the time the guest list was finalized—
It was clear that this wasn’t just any wedding.
This was THE wedding.

Step 1: The Guest List Disaster
At first, it was simple.
Shin’s Family → His parents, Hima, a few close relatives.


Kazama’s Side → A small circle of trusted friends.


Ai’s Side → Some family and close connections.


Easy, right?
WRONG.
Because Ai’s side didn’t just include family.
It included CEOs, investors, foreign dignitaries, and some of the richest, most powerful figures in the business world.
”We can’t just invite my uncle without inviting his colleagues.” Ai said. ”That would be rude.”
Shin blinked. ”…Your uncle is on the Forbes list.”
”Exactly.”
”…Ai. We are two idiots who grew up eating choco chips off the floor. We are NOT prepared for this.”
Kazama pinched the bridge of his nose. "You two have basically turned this into the wedding of the century."
And he wasn’t wrong.
Because when they looked at the list again—
Practically all of Kasukabe was coming.


Half of Stanford’s faculty and research students were coming.


Every one of their childhood friends was coming.


Ai’s business connections—including billionaires, CEOs, and some political figures—were coming.


Even some of Shin’s Kendo rivals RSVP’d because they heard about the wedding.


At this point, it would’ve been easier to make a public broadcast and invite the whole world.

Step 2: Flights, Hotels, and Total Chaos
Once the guest list was confirmed, the next nightmare arrived.
Because accommodating this many guests from Japan, the U.S., and other parts of the world was an entirely new problem.
"Alright, we need to book flights." Kazama muttered, typing furiously on his laptop.
"We need to arrange hotels for the guests." Ai added, checking a spreadsheet.
"We need to make sure my dad doesn’t embarrass me at the reception." Shin sighed, rubbing his temples.
Hima, sipping on a juice box, smirked. "Too late for that."

Step 3: Assigning Roles
They needed help.
So, they delegated.
Kazama handled the logistics. Flights, hotel reservations, guest accommodations. (And secretly making sure the media didn’t get too involved.)


Hima handled the wedding aesthetics. The venue, decorations, and outfits. (And she personally made sure Ai’s dress was perfect.)


Shin and Ai handled the ceremony details. Venue contracts, officiants, and keeping Shin from losing his mind.


Bo-chan and Masao were given the very serious task of making sure the food was top-tier.


And like that—
The biggest wedding operation in Kasukabe and Stanford history was set in motion.

Chapter 280: The Reunion of a Lifetime
If someone had told Shin ten years ago that every single person from his childhood, school, and even university days would gather under one roof for his wedding…
He would have laughed and said, "Yeah right, what is this? A final boss battle where every NPC I’ve ever interacted with suddenly shows up for the final cutscene?"
And yet—
Here they were.
Each of them in a completely different place in life, yet somehow, all gathered to celebrate him and Ai.

A Guest List Like No Other
When Shin scrolled through the final guest list, he had to pause.
He had met every single person on this list at some point in his life.
And now, years later, they were all walking completely different paths.
The Kasukabe Originals:
✅ Masao: Flying in from France, now the head chef at his own Michelin-star restaurant. (The same guy who once cried over soggy rice now runs one of the top-rated restaurants in Europe?)
✅ Bo-chan: Now a geologist, working on dinosaur fossils and prehistoric studies. (The same quiet kid who used to build sandcastles now digs up creatures older than humanity?)
✅ Nene: A bestselling author in Japan, selling over 2 million copies of her novels. (The same girl who used to dream of being rich is now actually making bank?)
The Sports Legends:
✅ Rika: Now a national-level Kendo champion, representing Japan. (Her matches were even being broadcast on TV.)
✅ Yuusuo: Now playing for Japan’s national football team. (The guy who used to run laps with Shin in high school was now in the freaking World Cup?)
✅ Hayashi: A doctor, working in one of Japan’s top hospitals. (The once-clumsy idiot was now saving lives?)
The Family and the Mentors:
✅ Shin’s Parents & Grandparents → Already tearing up over the wedding.
✅ Ai’s Parents & Grandmother → The proudest people in the room.
✅ Kazama’s Parents, Masao’s Parents, Nene’s Parents, Bo’s Parents… → They were all here.
✅ Their kindergarten teachers, their old elementary and high school teachers, their student council members from high school… → Why were so many people here??
Shin kept reading through the list and muttered, "What is this, an anime reunion arc?"
Kazama sighed. "You’re the one marrying a girl whose family name is enough to make half of Japan take a day off just to attend."

The Airport Arrivals
And then…
They started arriving.
One by one.
Day by day.
Planes landed from Japan, France, and different parts of the world, carrying people from every era of Shin’s life.
Masao arrived first, greeted by Shin at the airport. "Shin! I brought you the best wine from my restaurant! You better enjoy it!"


Bo arrived next, still as quiet as ever but gifted Shin an ancient fossilized ammonite.


Nene arrived last, dramatically putting on sunglasses. "I can’t believe I’m saying this, but your wedding is going to outsell my last book launch."


Rika and Yuusuo arrived together, both fresh off their latest tournaments, looking like actual celebrities.


Hayashi came straight from the hospital, still half in his doctor’s uniform. "Sorry, had surgery this morning. Almost missed my flight."


It wasn’t just a wedding anymore.
It was a historical event.
Shin sighed, running a hand through his hair. "Man, what the hell is this?"
Ai, standing beside him, smiled.
"This is your life, Shin. And everyone you’ve ever met is here to celebrate it."
And for once, Shin was speechless.

Chapter 281: The Chaos Before the Wedding
Shin thought he was the one getting married.
But apparently, his wedding was a nationwide project.
From the dress, the venue, the food, the guests, the invites—somehow, the entire wedding was being crowdsourced by everyone he had ever met in life.
And Shin?
He was just a bystander.

The War Room: Wedding Edition
A massive roundtable meeting was held in their house.
Everyone was there.
The Girls: Ai, Hima, Rika, Nene, Shin’s mom, Ai’s mom, Ai’s grandma, Kazama’s mom, Masao’s mom… literally every woman in their lives.


The Boys: Shin, Kazama, Masao, Bo, Yuusuo, Hayashi, and even Professor Hawthorne because why not?


At this point, Shin was convinced that this wasn’t a wedding but a world summit.
Ai’s Dress? The Council of Women had taken full control.
Shin’s Suit? The boys had formed a "Manly Suit Committee."
Food? Masao had thrown down his chef’s knife like a challenge.
Venue? Bo was already making calls.
Guest Handling? Kazama and Hima had military-level spreadsheets.
Invites & Gifts? Nene had designed them like they were exclusive VIP packages.
Shin sighed. "Are Ai and I even needed in this wedding?"
Kazama patted his shoulder. "No. Just show up on the day."

The Battle for Ai’s Wedding Dress
In a grand bridal boutique, a war was being fought.
Ai, Hima, Nene, Rika, their moms, and even Ai’s grandma had gathered.


Wedding dresses were being pulled out like swords in a battlefield.


"Something elegant!"
 "No, something dramatic!"
 "A traditional Japanese touch!"
 "A modern, Western design!"
Ai just sat in the dressing room, completely overwhelmed.
Meanwhile, Hima was enjoying every second.
"Sis, you’re too calm. You’re about to be the most beautiful bride ever!"
And after hours of battle…
A decision was made.
Ai stood in front of the mirror in a breathtaking dress—timeless, elegant, and designed to perfection.
Her mother had tears in her eyes.
"You look like a dream, Ai."
Ai turned, still nervous. "I just hope Shin likes it."
Nene scoffed. "Girl, if he doesn’t cry when he sees you, I’ll make him cry myself."

The Boys & The Suit Struggle
Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Shin was being tortured by Kazama, Masao, Bo, and Yuusuo in a high-end men’s boutique.
Kazama: "Shin, this is the most important suit of your life."
 Shin: "It’s just a suit, man."
 Masao: "Blasphemy. Look at this fabric. It was made for royalty."
 Bo: (Nods seriously.)
 Yuusuo: "Shin, you need to look legendary."
They forced him into several suits, adjusting everything—the color, the fit, the tie, the cufflinks.
Finally, after an exhausting trial…
Shin stepped out in a perfectly tailored suit.
A deep navy three-piece, fitted so well it made him look like a king.
Kazama crossed his arms. "Now, that’s the Shin Nohara who conquered Stanford."
Masao wiped a fake tear. "Our boy is getting married."
Bo simply gave a thumbs up.
Shin rolled his eyes. "You guys are dramatic."
But secretly?
He felt good.
Really good.

The Feast of the Century
Masao took over full control of the menu.
He spent weeks crafting a menu worthy of a Michelin-star event.
Japanese cuisine, French cuisine, Italian cuisine, desserts flown in from Paris, handcrafted cocktails—it was insane.


Even the appetizers were exquisite—truffle-infused dishes, Wagyu beef sliders, and seafood flown in fresh.


Masao personally trained the chefs handling the event.


"If a single dish is below perfection, I will personally riot."
Shin, watching all this, muttered, "I just wanted some good food, man…"
Masao turned sharply. "You’re getting food that even billionaires struggle to eat. Respect it."
Shin gulped. "Yes, Chef."

Bo’s Venue Magic
Bo somehow secured a wedding venue that looked like something out of a fairy tale.
A breathtaking private garden estate, with an open-sky view of the stars.
The ceremony would take place under the sunset.


The reception would be a starlit dinner.


Even Ai gasped when she saw it. "Bo… this is perfect."
Bo just nodded.
Shin patted his shoulder. "Man of few words, but damn, do you deliver."

Kazama & Hima’s Military-Style Guest Handling
Kazama and Hima were running logistics like wedding planners on steroids.
Flights booked, hotels arranged, transport scheduled.


They literally had a guest app made to track everyone’s arrival.


Hima stretched. "Shin-nii, you owe me for this."
Shin sighed. "I’ll buy you food for a year."
Kazama adjusted his glasses. "We’re at peak efficiency. No delays. No stress."
Ai blinked. "Kazama… why are you this good at this?"
Kazama shrugged. "I like control."
Shin smirked. "Yeah, no kidding."

Nene’s VIP Wedding Invitations
Nene went all out designing the invitations and gifts.
The wedding invites were handcrafted, looking more expensive than an Oscar award.


The gifts were custom-made: Luxury sake, handcrafted tea sets, leather goods with personalized engravings.


"No one leaves empty-handed."
Even Ai’s father was impressed. "This is… high-level."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "Nene, this is so over the top."
Nene smirked. "It’s not every day I get to plan a billionaire-level wedding."

The Final Days Before the Wedding…
And just like that—
The wedding preparations were done.
Everything was perfect.
The dress.
 The suit.
 The venue.
 The food.
 The guest arrangements.
 The invitations.
All that was left…
Was the moment itself.
Ai looked at Shin, a smile on her lips.
"Ready?"
Shin grinned.
"Let’s do this."
To be continued… THE WEDDING DAY IS NEXT. 🚀💍

Chapter 282: The Quiet Before the Storm
A week before the wedding, in the middle of the night, Shin and Kazama sat on the balcony of their apartment, drinking.
The city lights of San Francisco stretched below them, the faint sound of cars in the distance. The cool breeze carried the salty scent of the ocean, mixing with the faint aroma of their whiskey.
It had been a chaotic few months—planning, organizing, handling guests, preparations—but now, for the first time in what felt like forever, there was peace.
No last-minute wedding emergencies.
 No interruptions.
 Just the two of them.
Kazama took a sip of his drink, swirling the amber liquid in his glass. "I still can't believe it… Shin Nohara, getting married."
Shin scoffed, leaning back in his chair. "You say it like I was destined to be single forever."
Kazama smirked. "You were. Until Ai forcefully broke your obliviousness."
Shin chuckled. "…Fair point."
For a while, they sat in silence, the kind that only old friends could share without discomfort.
Then, after another sip, Shin hesitated.
He had something to ask.
But somehow, saying it felt… embarrassing.
He cleared his throat, suddenly feeling awkward. "Hey, uh… Kazama?"
Kazama raised an eyebrow. "Hmm?"
Shin stared at his glass, swirling the whiskey inside. He was never the type to get embarrassed, but this was different.
How do people even ask this?
"Oi, be my best man?"
 "Kazama, you down to stand next to me?"
 "You're basically already doing it, might as well make it official?"
Ugh, all of them sounded weird.
Kazama frowned. "What’s with the face? You look constipated."
"Damn it."
Shin sighed, scratching the back of his head. "Look, uh… you know how weddings have a best man and all…?"
Kazama blinked. "Yeah?"
Shin avoided eye contact. "…Wanna do it?"
There was a beat of silence.
Then—
"Pfft—HAHAHAHAHA!"
Kazama burst out laughing.
"Oh my god, is this what you were struggling to say? You were acting like you were about to confess to me!"
Shin groaned, covering his face. "Oi, don’t make it weird!"
Kazama wiped a fake tear. "This is priceless. Shin Nohara, the genius professor, struggling to ask a simple question."
Shin muttered under his breath, "Knew I should’ve just asked Masao instead…"
Kazama smirked. "Oh no, you’re stuck with me now."
He raised his glass. "Best man duties accepted."
Shin exhaled, finally relaxing. "Good. Because you were gonna do it either way."
Kazama clinked his glass against Shin’s. "Wouldn’t have it any other way."
They drank in silence after that, watching the city lights flicker below.
Shin grinned.
"Guess I really am getting married, huh?"
Kazama smirked.
"Yeah. And somehow, you made it look effortless."
A week left.
And then—
The wedding.
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 283: The Wedding of the Century
The world had caught wind of it.
The Nohara-Suotome wedding had become something far beyond just a wedding.
It was a global event.
It was absurd.
Yet, with the sheer magnitude of the guest list, it was understandable.
CEOs of multinational companies.
 World-renowned researchers and professors.
 Professional athletes at the peak of their careers.
 Bestselling authors, Michelin-star chefs, political figures, and more.
And then—the reporters.
No one knew exactly when they showed up, but by the morning of the wedding, there were camera crews stationed outside the venue, drones flying overhead, and live broadcasts from news channels covering the event.
It wasn’t just about Shin and Ai anymore.
It was about the people they had gathered together—an impossible combination of individuals that no one would ever expect to see in the same place.
A once-in-a-lifetime event.
And it all began in a quiet, elegant room.

The Bridal Room
Ai sat in front of the massive vanity mirror, her reflection looking back at her with an expression that was… oddly calm.
She should be nervous, right?
But she wasn’t.
There was only one thought running through her mind—
“It’s finally happening.”
Around her, the room was filled with the most important women in her life.
Himawari stood beside her, adjusting the delicate lace veil. "It's kind of unfair that you look this perfect before even wearing the dress."
Nene, flipping through the final guest list, still couldn’t believe the scale of the event. "I mean, I knew this was going to be huge, but the Prime Minister of Japan is actually here? What is this, a political summit?"
Rika smirked, leaning against the dresser. "No, no. Forget the Prime Minister. A literal Nobel Prize winner is attending. And half the Japanese national football team."
Ai’s mother, standing beside her daughter, gently adjusted her hair. "Of course. Everyone who’s ever crossed paths with Shin and Ai wanted to be here. It’s a wedding that only happens in fairytales."
Misae, Shin’s mother, folded her arms. "Hmm, I still can’t believe my idiot son is getting married before Kazama. It feels wrong somehow."
Ai giggled softly. "Shin might be an idiot, but he's my idiot."
Nene sighed dramatically. "How romantic."
Hima leaned in, whispering teasingly. "Don't get too sappy yet, Nee-chan. We still have to get through the ceremony first."
Ai smiled.
It still felt surreal.
She had imagined this moment a thousand times—when she was a child, when she first reunited with Shin in high school, and all the years after.
And now…
It was real.
She was about to marry Shin Nohara.
Her childhood love.
Her partner.
Her everything.
Ai took a deep breath. "Alright, let's do this."
With that, she stood up—ready to step into her wedding dress.
And outside, the world waited.
You said:
now to the BOIS pov.

Chapter 284: The Groom’s Room – Absolute Chaos
If the bridal room was a scene of elegance and quiet anticipation, the groom’s room was anything but.
The place was a disaster.
"WHERE THE HELL ARE HIS CUFFLINKS?!"
"I SWEAR THEY WERE RIGHT HERE A SECOND AGO!"
"KAZAMA, STOP ADJUSTING HIS TIE, IT’S FINE!"
"BO-CHAN, WHY DO YOU HAVE A FOSSIL RIGHT NOW?!"
"MASAO, YOU’RE LITERALLY A CHEF! WHY ARE YOU SWEATING MORE THAN SHIN?!"
In the center of it all, Shin Nohara sat there in his chair, perfectly calm, drinking a soda.
Kazama, his best man, was fixing and re-fixing his tie every three minutes while simultaneously yelling at Masao, who looked like he was about to faint.
Bo-chan stood quietly in the corner, casually examining a small fossilized ammonite he had somehow brought with him.
Yuzuo (now a national football player) and Hayashi (a doctor now, for God’s sake) were running around trying to find Shin’s missing cufflinks.
Meanwhile, Ryu, their old delinquent friend from high school, was standing with his arms crossed, grinning. "Man, this is so damn weird. Never thought I'd see the day you got married."
Shin took another sip of soda. "Same."
Kazama groaned, finally giving up on the tie and stepping back. "Shin, I swear, I have never seen a groom this relaxed before."
Masao, practically hyperventilating, turned to him. "WHY AREN’T YOU NERVOUS?! DUDE, YOU’RE GETTING MARRIED IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE WORLD!"
Shin blinked. "Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess so."
Kazama ran a hand through his hair. "I hate you."
Yuzuo came rushing over with the cufflinks, panting. "Found them! Some reporter almost took them as a souvenir!"
Hayashi groaned. "Why are there so many damn reporters?! Who the hell leaked the guest list?!"
Kazama sighed, shaking his head. "You know the answer. The guest list itself is insane. How could something like this not make headlines?"
Bo-chan finally spoke up, his deep, calm voice cutting through the chaos. "This wedding is basically a historical event."
Shin stretched, setting down his soda. "Well, that just means we need to make it even more memorable."
Masao collapsed onto a chair. "It’s already memorable, Shin!"
Kazama crossed his arms. "You’re seriously not even a little nervous?"
Shin thought about it for a second.
Then he smiled.
"Nope. Because at the end of the day, it’s just me and Ai. And that’s all that really matters."
The room fell silent for a moment.
Then Kazama sighed, shaking his head. "Damn it. You really are something else."
Yuzuo grinned. "Alright, let’s get this legend ready for the biggest moment of his life."
And with that, the final preparations began.
You said:
both of them came out, the entire hall was filled and noisy with people talking. but as soon as they saw each other, first they were in awe, and shin physically gasped and was soo red from seeing his beatiful fiance, secnd all the noise faded away, and it was just the 2 of them staring at each other.

Chapter 285: The Moment the World Stood Still
The grand wedding hall was a roaring ocean of voices. The sheer number of people—powerful CEOs, world-class scientists, award-winning authors, national athletes, childhood friends, family, and reporters—created an atmosphere so overwhelming that it barely felt real.
Photographers flashed their cameras, guests exchanged excited whispers, and anticipation buzzed in the air.
But then—
Ai stepped into the hall.
And in that very instant—
Shin Nohara forgot how to breathe.
For the first time in his life, the ever-relaxed, ever-carefree Shin physically gasped.
His face went completely red, his heartbeat pounding in his ears.
The grand hall, with all its noise and movement, might as well have disappeared.
Because in his eyes, there was only her.
Ai stood there, stunning beyond words.
Her wedding dress was elegant, flowing like liquid silver, fitting her like it had been made by the gods themselves. The subtle shimmer of the fabric caught the light perfectly, making her look almost ethereal. Her long, dark hair was styled elegantly, but loose strands framed her delicate face, giving her that perfect blend of regal and intimate beauty.
Her eyes—those sharp, intelligent, breathtakingly expressive eyes—locked onto his.
And in that moment, Ai felt everything.
The warmth, the history, the teasing, the challenges, the fights, the love—everything they had shared from childhood to now.
For the first time in her life, Ai Suotome was speechless.
It was just them.
Just Shin and Ai.
Nothing else existed.
All the noise in the hall vanished.
The reporters, the guests, the flashing cameras—it all faded into a blur.
Shin’s hands clenched at his sides, his mind blank, his heart racing.
"Damn."
That was the only thought in his head.
Kazama, standing nearby, whispered under his breath, "I have never seen this idiot so flustered in my life."
Masao, tears already forming in his eyes, whispered, "I think I'm going to pass out..."
Even Bo-chan, usually unreadable, smiled.
But none of that mattered.
Because Shin was still lost in Ai.
She took a slow step forward.
And Shin took one too.
They walked towards each other, like two souls drawn together by something more powerful than words.
And when they finally stood face-to-face, inches apart, Shin managed to find his voice—low, breathless, and full of everything he had never been able to say in words.
"You’re… breathtaking."
Ai’s lips curled into the softest, most genuine smile she had ever worn.
"So are you, my idiot."
And just like that—
The world started moving again.
You said:
wedding proceeds, but we need a bit of chaos not much as it had to be memorable.

Chapter 286: A Wedding to Remember (For Better or For Chaos)
The ceremony began with the perfect balance of elegance and warmth.
Ai, guided by her father, walked down the aisle, her every step exuding grace and confidence. Shin, for once in his life, was completely and utterly still. No jokes, no teasing—just a man standing there, fully captivated by the love of his life.
Kazama, standing as the best man, had never felt prouder… and also slightly second-hand nervous watching his best friend lose his usual composure.
Masao was already sniffling uncontrollably.
Bo-chan, true to himself, remained stone-faced but deeply moved.
Nene, Hima, Rika, and the rest of the girls watched proudly, resisting the urge to scream at how beautiful Ai looked.
Then—
Just as the vows were about to begin—
Chaos entered.
It started small.
A cough from one of the guests turned into a muffled laugh.
Then another snicker.
And then—
One of Ai’s business acquaintances accidentally opened his phone, and it blasted—
"SHINCHAN NOHARA! YOU STILL OWE ME 500 YEN FROM HIGH SCHOOL!"
…A recorded voice message, played at full volume.
Ai froze mid-vow.
Shin’s face twitched.
Kazama turned slowly toward Shin, horrified.
The entire hall burst into laughter.
“WHO SENT THAT!?” Shin shouted, completely breaking his composed groom act.
Then—a new challenger appeared.
One of their old kindergarten teachers shouted, “Shin-chan, you were always a troublemaker, but today, you actually look respectable for once!”
Shin dropped his head in embarrassment.
Masao, still crying, suddenly let out a LOUD SNIFFLE and choked out, “THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL, MAN!!”
Which caused Bo to finally speak: “Breathe, Masao.”
The priest cleared his throat, trying to regain control.
Ai, completely unfazed, simply looked at her humiliated groom and whispered, “Enjoying yourself?”
Shin glared at her. “You planned this, didn’t you?”
Ai just smiled mysteriously.
The ceremony continued.
But of course, it wouldn’t be a proper Shinchan wedding without—
THE RING DROPPING INCIDENT.
As the rings were being handed over—
Kazama sneezed.
The ring FLEW out of the box.
It hit the floor, rolled off the altar, and slid under a table.
For a solid three seconds, no one moved.
Then—
Shin and Kazama DOVE at the same time.
The guests cheered.
The photographers were frantically clicking.
And Ai?
She just stood there, arms crossed, watching her groom fight for the wedding ring like a madman.
After what felt like an eternity—
Shin emerged victorious, ring in hand, hair slightly messy but triumphant.
“Found it!” he announced proudly.
The entire hall applauded.
Ai sighed, shaking her head. “You’re such a child.”
Shin, grinning, took her hand. “And yet, you’re marrying me anyway.”
The priest, finally regaining control, wrapped up the vows.
Shin and Ai exchanged rings, finally sealing the moment.
Then—
"You may kiss the bride."
Shin grabbed Ai’s waist, dipped her backward dramatically, and kissed her.
The entire hall ERUPTED.
Reporters captured the moment, guests cheered, Masao literally fainted, and Hima fist-pumped the air.
And as they broke apart, Ai whispered against Shin’s lips—
"This is the best wedding I could’ve asked for."
And Shin, smiling softly, replied—
"Me too."
And just like that—
Shin Nohara and Ai Suotome were finally, officially—
Married.

Chapter 286: The Vows—A Promise Across Time
The moment had finally arrived.
Shin and Ai stood at the altar, facing each other, hands intertwined. The world around them—the crowd, the reporters, the murmurs—had all faded into a soft hum in the background. It was just the two of them now.
Ai’s dress shimmered under the soft golden glow of the chandeliers, and Shin, standing in his perfectly tailored suit, was completely captivated.
The priest cleared his throat. “The bride and groom have prepared their own vows.”
Ai took a deep breath, steadying herself. Her eyes softened as she looked at Shin.
“Shin-chan,” she began, her voice gentle but unwavering.
And suddenly—
—a memory surfaced.
—High school.
A makeshift wedding, a joke among friends. Ai stood before him, a paper veil on her head, the sunset spilling through the classroom window.
"Shin-chan, I vow… to always love you, even when you're being a total idiot."
The past and present blurred together.
Ai smiled, tears glistening in her eyes.
"Shin, I vow to love you... even when you're being a total idiot."
Shin’s eyes widened, a small laugh escaping him as the memory hit him too.
Ai continued, voice trembling slightly but filled with certainty.
"I vow to stand by your side, whether you're chasing an impossible problem or running away from your responsibilities—"
—Another memory.
Ai, in high school, crossing her arms as Shin slacked off on homework, groaning about how math was the devil’s invention.
"—because let’s be honest, you’re still going to do both."
The crowd laughed softly.
Shin bit his lip, fighting back his emotions.
Ai’s expression turned softer, more vulnerable.
"I vow to be the one who believes in you when you doubt yourself. I vow to be the one who keeps pushing you forward, just as you have always pushed me."
Another memory—
Ai, gripping Shin’s wrist in high school, dragging him toward the sign-up sheet for a competition, refusing to let him give up.
Her voice tightened with emotion.
"I vow to love you in every version of yourself—the reckless boy who made my childhood unforgettable, the brilliant man standing before me today, and the future you, whoever he may be."
Shin’s breath hitched.
Ai swallowed, blinking away tears.
"I vow to spend the rest of my life proving that I was right about you—that you are someone extraordinary."
She took a shaky breath, looking at him with so much love it nearly broke him.
"Because, Shin-chan... you are the love of my life."
Silence.
A pause.
Shin Nohara, for the first time in his life—had no words.
Kazama sniffed audibly.
Masao was already a mess.
Bo simply gave a small approving nod.
And Shin?
He exhaled slowly.
Then, he took her hands tighter in his.
His voice was quiet at first.
"Ai-chan..."
He blinked, looking at her, the love of his life, standing before him in a moment that felt too grand to exist.
And just like Ai—
A memory surfaced.
—High school.
"Ai-chan, I vow to be the best husband in the world!" Shin had declared, arms crossed, full of confidence, during their fake wedding.
"You don’t even know what being a husband means," Ai had teased.
"I do! It means I get to eat your lunchboxes forever!"
Ai had rolled her eyes, laughing.
Shin took a breath and smiled through his tears.
"Ai-chan, I vow to be the best husband I can possibly be."
Ai let out a soft laugh, recognizing the words.
"I vow to make you laugh at least once every day, even if it's because I did something stupid—"
Another memory—
Shin, in high school, sitting across from Ai during lunch, stuffing too much rice into his mouth and choking immediately.
Ai had sighed before handing him water, but her smile had been unmistakable.
"—which, let’s be real, is going to happen."
The guests chuckled.
But then, Shin’s voice lowered.
"I vow to be there for you when you’re exhausted, when you’re stressed, when you’re pushing yourself too hard—because I know you. And I know you’ll never stop giving your all to the people you love."
Ai’s lips parted slightly, taking in the sincerity in his eyes.
"I vow to stand beside you in every battle you face. I vow to remind you to rest, to smile, to breathe, because no matter how strong you are… even you need someone to lean on."
Shin took a breath, then laughed softly.
"I vow to remind you that it’s okay to let me take care of you too."
Another pause.
And then, his voice trembled just a little.
"Ai-chan, you’ve been the love of my life since I was five years old. And I don’t care if it took me years to understand that—I know it now."
His grip on her hands tightened.
"And I vow to spend the rest of my life proving it to you."
Ai’s breath hitched.
Her eyes shined with unshed tears.
The entire hall was silent.
Then—
The priest, smiling warmly, said the words—
"Do you, Ai Suotome, take Shin Nohara to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
Ai exhaled, tears finally spilling as she whispered—
"I do."
A deep breath.
"And do you, Shin Nohara, take Ai Suotome to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
Shin, still staring at her as if she was the most breathtaking thing on earth, smiled.
"I do."
The priest’s smile widened.
"Then by the power vested in me—"
Shin didn’t wait.
He kissed her.
And the whole world erupted into cheers.
You said:
continue.

Chapter 287: The Wedding of the Century
The moment their lips met, the entire hall erupted into thunderous cheers.
Cameras flashed, guests stood up clapping, and their closest friends let out loud whoops of excitement.
Kazama, ever the composed one, clapped firmly, a satisfied smirk on his face. Hima was practically jumping in excitement, nudging Kazama repeatedly like, “Did you see that?! Did you see that?!”
Masao had fully broken down in tears, sobbing into his napkin like this was the most romantic thing he’d ever witnessed. Nene, sitting next to him, sighed loudly and passed him a fresh handkerchief.
Bo simply nodded approvingly, muttering, “Good for them.”
And then—
A loud cough.
“Alright, alright, give the man some air,” Kazama said, dragging Shin back before he could fully devour Ai in front of their guests.
Shin, grinning uncontrollably, wiped the corner of his lips. “What? She’s my wife now.”
Ai, flustered and red, smacked his arm lightly, but her smile was impossible to hide.
The priest chuckled. “Well, that’s certainly the most enthusiastic kiss I’ve seen in a wedding.”
The crowd laughed.
The ceremony proceeded smoothly, but the weight of what just happened—of their vows, their promises, their love—still hung in the air, making every glance between them feel heavier, more real.
Then came the signing of the marriage certificate.
Ai gracefully signed first, her handwriting elegant and practiced.
Shin… well—
“Why does it look like a kindergarten kid signed this?!” Ai whispered, staring at his barely legible scrawl.
Shin pouted. “Hey, my handwriting is a unique form of expression.”
Kazama leaned over, unimpressed. “It expresses illiteracy.”
The guests burst into laughter, making Shin groan while Ai covered her mouth to stifle a giggle.
And then—
It was official.
They were married.
The Chaos Ensues
Of course, this wouldn’t be a wedding involving Shin Nohara without a little bit of chaos.
First, there was the bouquet toss.
Ai stood with her back to a crowd of eager women—Hima, Nene, Rika, and several other guests standing in full competitive stance.
Hima cracked her knuckles. “I got this.”
Nene smirked. “You wish.”
Rika, ever the athlete, was already calculating the trajectory in her head.
And then—Ai threw the bouquet.
For a brief moment, it was a blur in the air.
And then—
Absolute chaos.
Hima dove forward, arms outstretched. Nene elbowed someone out of the way. Rika jumped, snatching at the air.
But the bouquet…
It landed directly in Bo’s hands.
The entire room froze.
Bo, who had been casually drinking a glass of wine, stared blankly at the bouquet now in his grasp.
Silence.
And then Masao—ever dramatic—gasped, clutching his chest.
“B-Bo-chan! Does this mean you’re next?!”
Bo blinked. “…I was just standing here.”
Nene, dusting herself off, sighed. “Well, I didn’t see that coming.”
Ai laughed, taking Shin’s hand as they watched the spectacle unfold.
And then came the reception.
A Feast to Remember
Masao had outdone himself.
The wedding banquet was nothing short of a Michelin-star experience, featuring everything from delicate French hors d'oeuvres to rich Japanese cuisine. Each dish was an experience, a work of art, and guests couldn’t stop raving about it.
Shin, however, was too distracted to care about the food.
“You’re barely eating,” Ai pointed out.
Shin grinned. “I already have everything I want.”
Ai’s face turned red. “D-Don’t say that so casually!”
Kazama, seated next to them, rolled his eyes. “You two are impossible.”
And then came the first dance.
Dancing Under the Stars
The lights dimmed. The dance floor opened. And as soft, elegant music filled the air, Shin and Ai took each other’s hands and stepped into the spotlight.
Shin, despite all his brilliance, was not the best dancer.
Ai quickly realized this.
"You're stepping on my foot," she whispered.
"That was your foot? I thought it was part of the floor," Shin muttered.
Ai sighed, but she smiled.
Slowly, the awkwardness melted away. With Ai leading, guiding his movements, the two of them swayed effortlessly under the warm glow of the chandeliers.
Then—a moment of magic.
The ceiling above them opened slightly, revealing the clear night sky.
A breathtaking array of stars twinkled down at them, and Ai’s breath hitched.
Shin, still holding her close, whispered, “I planned this.”
Ai turned to him, eyes wide. “You—?”
Shin smirked. “I wanted the first time we danced as husband and wife to be under the stars.”
Ai’s eyes shimmered with pure love.
She rested her forehead against his. “I love you.”
Shin kissed her softly. “I love you too.”
And as the music swelled, as the stars bore witness to their love, the world seemed to pause—just for them.
They had waited for this moment their whole lives.
And now—it was theirs.

Chapter 288: The Wedding That Solved the Unsolvable
Shin sat at the grand banquet table, a glass of fine wine in his hand, as waves of guests came by to congratulate them.
The room was alive with conversation and laughter, a melting pot of personalities and backgrounds—CEOs, athletes, scientists, artists, old childhood friends, and even their kindergarten teachers.
It was a miracle how they all fit into one room, coexisting, their lives vastly different yet seamlessly intertwined.
And then—
Shin’s eyes widened.
A strange, creeping familiarity settled into his mind.
He looked around—at Kazama, now a titan in the corporate world; at Bo, who spent his days unearthing fossils millions of years old; at Masao, a culinary genius; at Nene, a best-selling author; at Hima, destined to be a powerhouse in law; at Ai, the love of his life, effortlessly balancing her empire.
Every person in the room was different—so incredibly different—yet they moved together, harmonized like a complex system that somehow… worked.
That’s when it hit him.
Navier-Stokes.
His mind snapped open like a floodgate.
It wasn’t just a math problem anymore. It was right in front of him.
He saw it—the invisible patterns, the flow, the structure hidden in the chaos of the banquet hall.
People moved like particles in a fluid, interactions bouncing off each other, creating currents, turbulence, stability in instability.
His heart started pounding.
His fork stopped halfway to his mouth.
Then, as if possessed, he dropped his fork entirely and pressed his fingers against his temple.
It was happening.
Like an explosion in his head, ideas burst to life, numbers colliding, equations forming out of sheer instinct.
This is it.
He barely registered the voices around him.
Ai, next to him, nudged his arm. “Shin?”
Nothing.
Kazama, across from him, raised an eyebrow. “Uh… you good?”
No response.
Shin’s entire world had shrunk down to one thing:
Solving. The. Damn. Problem.
His breath quickened.
His fingers twitched on the table, mentally writing out calculations.
He was seeing the structure now—the missing piece, the bridge between mathematics and reality.
“Holy shit,” he whispered.
Ai blinked. “What?”
Shin’s eyes snapped to her, wild with realization.
“I know how to solve it.”
Ai frowned. “Solve what—?”
But before she could finish, Shin jumped out of his seat.
Chairs scraped loudly as he stood abruptly, nearly knocking over a waiter.
“I have to go. Right now.”
Kazama’s expression darkened. “Shin, this is your wedding.”
“I—” Shin froze.
Right.
Right.
His wedding.
His new wife sat beside him, still in her wedding dress, looking up at him with eyes filled with concern and love.
Shin swallowed hard.
This was their night. Their perfect, once-in-a-lifetime night.
But…
Ai reached for his hand and squeezed it.
“…Go.”
Shin’s breath hitched. “What?”
She smiled softly.
“If it’s calling you right now, go.”
Shin’s heart clenched.
There was a reason he loved her more than anything.
“Ai…”
She leaned up, kissing his cheek. “Just promise me one thing.”
Shin cupped her face. “Anything.”
Her voice was soft, but filled with certainty.
“Come back with the answer.”
Shin’s lips curled into a determined grin.
“…I will.”
And then—
He turned, dashed out of the banquet hall, and ran like hell.
The biggest night of his life had just become the biggest breakthrough of the century.

Chapter 289: The Lipstick Proof of the Century
Shin sprinted.
His wedding shoes weren’t made for running, but it didn’t matter. He flew through the corridors of the venue, heart hammering, brain firing at full throttle.
He needed Hawthorne.
He needed NOW.
Bursting into the main hall where guests were still enjoying their dinner, he scanned the crowd.
There—Professor Hawthorne, sipping his whiskey, deep in discussion with a few researchers.
Shin didn’t slow down.
He grabbed the professor’s wrist without warning.
“H-Hey! Nohara, what in the—?!”
“No time,” Shin yanked the older man out of his seat, practically dragging him across the hall.
“Shin?!” Kazama stood up. Ai covered her mouth, barely suppressing a laugh.
Masao, mouth full of food, mumbled, “There he goes.”
Hawthorne stumbled after Shin, trying to steady himself. “What the hell is going on?! Where are you taking me?!”
Shin didn’t even look back. “To the only damn place I can write this down.”
They barreled through the venue until they reached a door—Ai’s bridal suite.
Shin kicked it open.
Inside, the delicate wedding dress still hung on its stand, surrounded by mirrors reflecting a thousand versions of themselves.
Hawthorne, catching his breath, threw up his hands. “Okay, this is ridiculous! You storm into your own wedding, kidnap your professor, and drag me into the bridal suite—what the hell are you thinking?!”
Shin’s mind was moving too fast to explain. He scanned the room.
He needed something to write with.
Fast.
His gaze landed on the dressing table.
Lipstick.
Perfect.
He snatched a deep-red lipstick from the counter and, before Hawthorne could even process what was happening, Shin started writing on the mirror.
Equations.
Vectors.
Differential operators.
The entire Navier-Stokes framework poured out of his brain and onto the glass, written in bold strokes of lipstick.
Hawthorne’s protest died in his throat.
Because as soon as he saw the equations—he understood.
The impossible was happening right before his eyes.
The reflections of the equations in the mirror multiplied, filling the room with an endless maze of the problem and its solution, converging in a place where no one had dared to tread before.
Shin kept writing, faster and faster, his brain catching fire.
He whispered, “This is it. This is it.”
Hawthorne staggered back, running a trembling hand through his hair. “Holy mother of God…”
It was happening.
Shin Nohara, in his freaking wedding tuxedo, using lipstick on a bridal mirror, was about to crack one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics.
His hands were shaking, but his writing remained precise. He adjusted a coefficient, rewrote a limit, streamlined a proof.
And then—
It all clicked.
The missing piece.
The breakthrough that no one had seen.
Hawthorne’s voice was barely a whisper. “…You solved it.”
Shin, breathless, took a step back, staring at the mirror, at the tangled mess of equations that, for the first time in human history, made perfect sense.
He exhaled.
Then grinned.
“…I did.”
And outside, just beyond the door—
Ai, Kazama, Hima, and half the wedding guests, having followed the chaos, stood in stunned silence.
Then, Masao, ever the poet, spoke.
“…Did this man just solve Navier-Stokes with lipstick?”

the wedding literally exploded after this.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 290: The Wedding That Broke the World
For exactly three seconds, the entire room was silent.
Then—
The wedding exploded.
Not literally. But socially? Culturally? Mathematically?
Absolutely.
Shin turned to face the doorway, where Ai, Kazama, Hima, and nearly half the wedding guests were staring at the lipstick-smeared mirror in absolute shock.
Then the screaming started.
“OH MY GOD, HE REALLY DID IT?!”
“WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!”
“DID HE JUST SOLVE NAVIER-STOKES AT HIS OWN WEDDING?!”
“WITH A LIPSTICK?!”
Kazama was gripping the doorframe like he was physically holding himself together. “Shin, you absolute madman—WHAT EVEN IS THIS?!”
Hima had both hands on her head. “BRO, ARE YOU SERIOUS?!”
Masao, ever dramatic, collapsed onto the floor. “Mathematics has peaked. Science has peaked. Civilization itself has peaked.”
Ai blinked. Once. Twice.
Then she marched into the room.
She looked at the mirror, then at Shin. Back at the mirror. Then at the completely flabbergasted Professor Hawthorne.
Then, with the grace of a bride who had already accepted she married a lunatic, she placed her hands on her hips.
“…Did you just solve one of the biggest problems in mathematics with my lipstick?”
Shin, still high on the thrill of discovery, barely processed the situation. He turned to her, grinning like a maniac. “I mean, technically, yeah—”
Ai exhaled through her nose.
Then she took a deep, steady breath.
Then—
She grabbed his tie, yanked him down, and kissed him.
The wedding hall erupted.
“WHOOOOO!!!”
“THIS IS INSANE!!”
“A LOVE STORY AND A MATHEMATICAL BREAKTHROUGH IN ONE NIGHT?!”
The sound of glasses clinking, people cheering, cameras flashing—the wedding went from elegant to absolutely unhinged in a matter of seconds.
Hawthorne, still looking shell-shocked, turned to Kazama. “Is he always like this?”
Kazama just took a deep sip of his champagne. “You have no idea.”
And then—the news spread.
Guests were already on their phones, live-streaming, texting, and calling.
In Japan, in Europe, in every university in the world, professors and mathematicians were waking up to notifications like:
[BREAKING: SHIN NOHARA SOLVES NAVIER-STOKES DURING HIS OWN WEDDING?!?!]
[Shin Nohara, Stanford researcher, allegedly proves Navier-Stokes in the middle of his wedding reception with a lipstick???]
[This man just made history IN A TUXEDO.]
The news was moving faster than physics itself.
Shin, still a little dazed from both the problem and the kiss, turned to Ai.
“So… we’re cool, right?”
Ai sighed. “We are. But you owe me a new lipstick.”
Shin grinned. “Fair.”
And with that, the biggest wedding of the century officially spiraled into madness.

things didnt end there, a lot was to coming immediately the next day.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 291: The Wedding Aftermath—A Storm is Brewing
If Shin thought solving one of the greatest unsolved problems in mathematics would mean a peaceful honeymoon, he was dead wrong.
Because the world did not sleep that night.

The Morning After: Chaos at the Nohara-Suotome Household
The first sign that life had permanently changed was the phone call at 5 AM.
Ai, still half-asleep, groaned as the phone on her nightstand buzzed nonstop. She reached for it with one hand, still curled up under the silk sheets.
[Incoming Call: Father]
Oh.
She squinted at the other notifications—over 200 missed calls and messages.
Ai sighed, sitting up. Shin, next to her, was still fast asleep, his hair an absolute mess. The only man in history who could both get married and change the scientific world on the same night, and still sleep like a rock.
She picked up the call.
Her father’s voice was unbelievably calm. “Daughter. Your husband has shaken the world.”
Ai pinched the bridge of her nose. “I know, Father.”
“The President of Stanford called me.”
She froze. “…What?”
“So did MIT. Harvard. Oxford. Cambridge. Tokyo University. Every institution with a physics or mathematics department is trying to contact him.”
Ai sighed. “…And?”
“…The White House called.”
Ai blinked. “I’m sorry—WHAT?!”
Shin groaned next to her, turning over. “Mmm… Five more minutes… Tell America to wait…”

Meanwhile, at Kazama & Hima’s Place
Kazama, who had barely slept, was holding his phone like it was a nuclear bomb.
Hima was still in her Harvard Law hoodie, scrolling through Twitter with the most tired expression.
“Big bro’s trending worldwide.”
Kazama rubbed his temples. “Shin just had to make history at his wedding.”
Hima sighed. “This man really said, ‘I do’ and ‘I just revolutionized mathematics’ in the same night.”
Then, the doorbell rang.
They both exchanged looks.
Kazama checked his phone. No delivery notifications. No scheduled visitors.
Hima shrugged and opened the door—
And standing there was a group of Japanese government officials.
Kazama nearly spilled his coffee.
Hima blinked. “…Okay, what?”
One of the officials bowed. “We would like to speak with Nohara Shin.”
Kazama sighed. “Of course you would.”

Back at the Hotel: The Press Has Arrived
The second Shin and Ai stepped out of their suite, the hotel lobby was flooded.
Journalists. Scientists. Reporters from every major network.
It was an ambush.
One reporter shoved a mic forward. “Shin Nohara, are you aware that you’ve just made one of the greatest discoveries of the century?”
Another: “Mr. Nohara, how did you come up with the proof? Can you confirm the details?”
Shin, still half-awake, scratched his head. “Uh… I was eating steak?”
The press lost their minds.
Ai grabbed his hand, sighing. “We are not doing a press conference in the hotel lobby.”
Hawthorne suddenly appeared, smoking an ungodly amount of coffee. “Too late. The university’s organizing one at noon.”
Shin groaned. “I just got married, man.”
Hawthorne patted his shoulder. “And you just changed mathematics. Congrats.”

The Press Conference at Stanford
At noon sharp, the largest press conference Stanford had ever hosted was underway.
The auditorium was packed—scientists, researchers, professors, journalists, students, even government representatives.
Shin sat at the center, still in his black suit from the wedding reception, looking slightly dazed. Ai sat beside him, composed. Hawthorne was next to him, sipping coffee like his life depended on it.
The Stanford President stood at the podium.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today for a truly unprecedented event. Last night, Shin Nohara, a Stanford researcher, made a breakthrough in the Navier-Stokes Problem. A problem that has remained unsolved for over two centuries.”
The entire auditorium erupted in murmurs.
A reporter stood. “Mr. Nohara, how do you feel about your discovery?”
Shin adjusted his mic. “…Honestly? I just wanted to eat my wedding dinner, man.”
Laughter.
A scientist stood up. “Mr. Nohara, could you summarize your proof?”
Shin leaned forward. “Imagine a room full of wedding guests—completely different people, but somehow they coexist in a way that doesn’t break reality.”
He gestured with his hands. “Fluids, mathematically, should function the same way. The key is finding the structure in the chaos.”
Silence. Then—whispers of awe.
Another question. “What do you plan to do next?”
Shin smirked. “Get some sleep.”

Meanwhile, Across the World…
In Japan, at his childhood home, Hiroshi Nohara sat at the dining table, looking at the TV where his son was currently explaining the solution to a problem beyond his comprehension.
He sipped his beer.
Then turned to Misae. “…Our idiot really did it.”
Misae sighed. “Took him long enough.”
Himawari, watching on her phone, grinned. “Guess I have to study even harder now.”

The World Reacts
By the next morning, every scientific institution, every government, every billionaire in tech and academia, was trying to get in contact.
Stanford offered him tenure.
MIT sent an open invitation.
The Fields Medal Committee was already talking.
And somewhere, deep in the offices of the Nobel Prize Committee, a discussion was being had.
But Shin?
Shin was back home, lying on the couch, eating instant ramen.
Ai scrolled through her emails. “Stanford wants you to give a formal lecture on your proof.”
Shin groaned. “Tell them I’m on my honeymoon.”
Ai smirked. “You haven’t even gone on one yet.”
Shin grinned, setting down his ramen. “…Exactly.”
To be continued.
You said:
people continued with this, but then shin saw a bit sadden look on her face then he suddenly stood up and shouted and said, he just got marraid yesterday. it hasnt even been a day since, he couldnt even peacefully have his wedding night , and pulling ai by her shoulder and said he wanted to give ai the time she deserved after the wedding. these press conferences can be done later.

Chapter 292: The Honeymoon Announcement—Shin’s Mic Drop Moment
The press conference was still in full swing, reporters throwing questions faster than Shin could process. His solution to the Navier-Stokes Problem had shaken the world, and now everyone wanted a piece of him.
But then—he saw it.
A small, almost imperceptible sadness in Ai’s eyes.
She was composed as always, answering questions when needed, keeping her posture elegant and professional. But Shin knew her better than anyone.
She hadn’t said a word about it.
Hadn’t complained once.
But reality was clear.
Yesterday was their wedding. Their long-awaited moment, years in the making. And instead of waking up to a peaceful morning as husband and wife, Ai had spent the entire time dealing with reporters, universities, and government calls.
Shin suddenly felt disgusted with himself.
"Oi." His voice cut through the air.
The room fell silent.
Shin stood up so fast his chair screeched against the floor.
Everyone turned to him in confusion. Even Ai blinked, startled.
Then, with zero hesitation, Shin shouted—
"I JUST GOT MARRIED YESTERDAY!"
The entire auditorium went dead silent.
People froze. Cameras stopped clicking. Hawthorne nearly spilled his coffee.
Shin wasn't done.
“It hasn't even been a full DAY since I married the love of my life! Do you guys realize that?! I couldn’t even have a peaceful wedding night, let alone spend actual time with my wife! And you want me to sit here and answer questions like I have nothing better to do?!”
Everyone looked shocked.
The reporters started murmuring among themselves. Ai widened her eyes, her mouth slightly open.
Shin took a deep breath, then grabbed Ai by the shoulder, pulling her slightly toward him.
“I love my wife, and I want to give her the time she deserves. All these press conferences? They can wait. The world’s been waiting for a solution for over 200 years. They can wait a little longer.”
There was a heavy pause.
Then—
Silence.
And then—
Thunderous applause.
The room exploded.
Reporters were whispering furiously, camera shutters were clicking like crazy, and even some of the professors in the room looked impressed.
Stanford’s president, standing off to the side, let out a long sigh, rubbing his temples. “Well… I can’t argue with that.”
Hawthorne chuckled. “Atta boy.”
Shin, ignoring all of them, looked at Ai.
She was staring at him, completely speechless.
And then—her lips trembled.
A quiet laugh escaped her. Then another. Until she was full-on giggling, covering her mouth.
Shin blinked. “Oi, what’s so funny?”
Ai wiped her eyes. “…You.”
She shook her head, still smiling. “You always do things in the most dramatic way possible, don’t you?”
Shin grinned. “Gotta make it memorable, right?”
She sighed, but the sadness in her eyes was gone.

After the Press Conference: The Escape
As soon as they stepped out of the building, Shin grabbed Ai’s hand and ran.
"Shin—what are you doing?!" Ai yelped as he dragged her down the university steps.
"Escaping, obviously! If we stick around, they’re just gonna keep bothering us!"
Ai glanced back and—yep. The press was already following them.
"Oh for—fine, where are we going?!" she shouted.
Shin grinned. "Our honeymoon, duh!"
Ai froze mid-step. “…Wait. What?”
Shin didn’t stop running. "We’re ditching everything and leaving today! I already called Kazama and Hima—they’re handling everything else! You and I? We’re going on a REAL break, no science, no press, just us.”
Ai stared at him, stunned.
And then—
A genuine, completely unfiltered laugh bubbled out of her.
She tightened her grip on his hand. “Alright, Mr. Nohara. Take me away.”
Shin smirked. "With pleasure, Mrs. Nohara."
And with that, the two of them disappeared into the streets—leaving the chaos of the world behind.
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Chapter 293: The Answer the World Had Been Waiting For
Three months.
For three whole months, the world had been waiting.
Waiting to hear what exactly Shin had discovered.
Universities, research institutes, mathematicians, physicists, engineers—every single person in the academic world was holding their breath.
And then—finally—
The press conference was announced.

Stanford University - The Grand Hall
The massive auditorium was packed.
This wasn’t just a university event anymore. It was global.
Live cameras were set up in multiple languages, broadcasting the event worldwide. Seats were filled with Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, industry leaders, and world-renowned physicists.
Even the general public had tuned in, despite half of them not even understanding what the problem was.
Why?
Because the world loved a genius.
And right now, Shin Nohara was the name on everyone’s lips.

The Moment Arrives
A hush fell over the hall as Shin finally walked onto the stage.
Dressed professionally for once, in a sleek black suit, he looked… different. Not like the carefree troublemaker everyone knew.
There was a calm confidence in his stride.
He wasn’t nervous.
Not even a little.
He stood at the podium, adjusted the mic, then looked at the audience.
A brief pause.
Then—
He smirked.
"I assume everyone here has been waiting for quite a while, huh?"
Soft chuckles rippled through the room.
Even the most serious professors couldn’t help but smile.
But then Shin’s smirk faded.
He turned to the massive screen behind him, where his presentation was about to begin.
"The Navier-Stokes Problem."
The screen displayed the infamous equations—the set of partial differential equations that had stumped the world’s greatest minds for over two centuries.
Shin placed both hands on the podium.
"For those who aren’t familiar, this problem deals with fluid motion. Water, air, blood in our veins—these equations should, theoretically, be able to describe them all. But there’s a problem."
He gestured to the screen.
"For over 200 years, we've been unable to prove whether these equations always have smooth solutions. That means we don’t know if, under certain conditions, fluids will behave in unpredictable ways—chaos, singularities, breakdowns in our equations."
He turned back to the audience.
"And because of that, we’ve been stuck."
The room was dead silent.
Shin exhaled and smiled slightly.
"Well. Until now."
A collective breath was taken.
Here it comes.
The solution.
The moment that would change everything.

The Grand Reveal
Shin stepped to the side, and the screen behind him shifted.
Long, complex equations started appearing. Pages upon pages of work.
A murmur spread across the room as mathematicians started reading.
Their eyes widened.
Some of them leaned forward, gripping their pens tightly.
Shin gestured towards the screen.
"What I discovered was this—Navier-Stokes DOES have smooth solutions… but only under a specific transformation of variables that decouple velocity and pressure in a non-trivial way."
He clicked forward.
"I introduce a new framework—one that blends harmonic analysis, probability theory, and geometric flow."
The screen changed again.
Diagrams. Graphs. Models.
Shin explained everything in precise, clear detail.
And as he spoke, the room’s energy changed.

The Room Reacts
People’s expressions went from curiosity… to shock.
To disbelief.
Hushed voices spread across the hall. Some were furiously scribbling notes. Others were shaking their heads in awe.
Professor Hawthorne, standing near the back, had his arms crossed, smiling proudly.
Kazama and Ai sat in the front row, watching the reactions unfold.
Kazama smirked. "There it is. The moment people realize he actually did it."
Ai chuckled. "Took them long enough."

The Final Statement
Shin, after finishing his final set of explanations, turned back to the audience.
He paused. Looked at them.
Then he grinned.
"So. Any questions?"
For a second—nobody spoke.
Then—
The room erupted.
Applause. Murmurs. Professors scrambling to form questions.
The entire world had just witnessed history.
Shin Nohara had done it.
He had cracked one of the hardest problems in mathematics.
And in that moment, as cameras flashed and people cheered—Shin just stood there, hands in his pockets, looking like he hadn’t just changed the world.
Like he had just solved a puzzle for fun.
You said:
the entirity of the world of science and math had been changed forever, now entering a completely new chain of discoveries originating from this revelation from shin.... and well shin got a award check of 5 MILLION dollars for solving the quesrion from what ever oraganisation had placed the prize.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 294: The Shockwaves of a Genius
The world of science and mathematics would never be the same again.
What Shin had done wasn’t just another breakthrough.
It was the breakthrough.
A turning point.
His solution to the Navier-Stokes Problem wasn’t just an answer—it was a foundation.
New equations. New theories. New possibilities.
The world of physics and engineering had been pushed into a new era.
And the ripple effect had already begun.

A Chain Reaction Across the World
Everywhere—universities, research labs, engineering firms—the world was shifting.
NASA, the European Space Agency, and private space companies were already integrating his work into aerodynamics and spacecraft design.
Medical researchers were applying his equations to blood flow dynamics, making groundbreaking progress in cardiovascular treatments.
Climate scientists had new models for predicting weather and ocean currents with unmatched accuracy.
AI researchers were refining neural networks using Shin’s mathematical principles.
And in the world of pure mathematics, new papers were being published daily—all citing his work.
Shin Nohara had changed everything.

The Reward of a Genius
As Shin sat in his office at Stanford, exhausted from the endless interviews and conference invitations, his email pinged.
A new message.
From the Clay Mathematics Institute.
Shin opened it lazily, sipping his coffee.
And then—
He nearly choked.
Subject: Official Confirmation of Millennium Prize Award
Dear Professor Nohara,
We are pleased to inform you that your resolution of the Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness problem has been officially recognized by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

Congratulations.
Five. Million. Dollars.
Shin blinked.
Kazama, sitting across from him, raised an eyebrow. “You good?”
Shin slowly turned his laptop to face him.
Kazama leaned in, read the email—
And then, for the first time in his life—he actually screamed.
“FIVE MILLION!??”
Ai, who had just entered the room, almost dropped her coffee. “EXCUSE ME??”
Shin leaned back in his chair, rubbing his temples.
“I mean… yeah, I guess?”
Hima barged in. “DID I JUST HEAR FIVE MILLION??”
Masao called from France. “BRO, WHAT THE HELL??”
Nene FaceTimed him. “SHIN, ARE YOU SERIOUS??”
Shin, exhausted, just groaned. “WHY IS EVERYONE YELLING?”
Kazama slammed his hands on the table. “BRO. BECAUSE YOU JUST BECAME A MILLIONAIRE.”
Ai folded her arms. “So. What’s the plan with all that money?”
Shin sighed.
Then he smirked.
“I dunno.” He stretched. “Maybe… buy a bigger TV?”
The room exploded in chaos again.
You said:
things start to settle down both for shin and ai and for the world. shin and ai now live in a huge house of their own. with so much money there wasnt any need for work so shin continued his work as a professor but only part timed for some special lectures only, now already thinking about other clay insittute problems, but this time at a extremely slowed pace this time he chose (choose like a really important one and cool too). but he also spent all the time her missed with ai, due to his work. he also thought of joing her dads company, like the option was still present. but there now was a still time between ai and shin of being together as husband and wife.
ChatGPT said:
Chapter 295: A Life Worth Living
For the first time in years, Shin Nohara slowed down.
No more sleepless nights hunched over equations.
 No more rushing to research labs at dawn.
 No more pressure to solve the impossible.
The world had settled.
 Their lives had settled.
And Shin and Ai…
They could finally just be together.

A Home for the Two of Them
Their new house wasn’t just big—it was massive.
Not in a flashy, gaudy way, but in a way that made sense for them.
Spacious. Peaceful. Filled with warmth.
A private study for Ai, where she spent hours reading and working.
 A sleek, sunlit office for Shin, though he mostly used it for doodling on whiteboards.
 A huge kitchen—because even though they had hired chefs, Shin still wanted to cook sometimes.
 A sprawling backyard, big enough for future possibilities.
And, most importantly—
A life where they weren’t rushing anymore.

A Professor, But Only When He Feels Like It
With so much money, there wasn’t really a need for work anymore.
But Shin liked teaching.
He liked seeing that spark in a student’s eyes when they finally understood something.
So instead of full-time work, he chose to only teach special lectures at Stanford—
 Classes where he got to pick his own topics and teach however he wanted.
The university didn’t care—he was literally a once-in-a-lifetime genius.
Even if he taught once a year, they’d still call him Professor Nohara.

The Next Big Problem
Shin wasn’t done with mathematics.
Not yet.
He’d already revolutionized fluid dynamics—so now, he wanted something bigger.
And he found it.
The Riemann Hypothesis.
A problem that had haunted mathematicians for over 160 years.
A problem that was tied to the very nature of prime numbers and encryption.
Solving it could change everything—
 From how we understand the universe to how we keep our data secure.
Shin had no deadline.
No rush.
He’d take his time.
Slowly. Carefully.
This time, he’d solve it at his own pace.

Time With Ai
For years, Ai had supported him through everything.
Through late nights.
 Through stressful days.
 Through every single moment where he was lost in his own mind.
And now, he was making up for all of it.
Trips to Europe, Japan, and small islands no one had even heard of.
 Lazy mornings with breakfast in bed.
 Evenings spent watching sunsets together, without a single thought of equations.
 Dancing in their living room, barefoot, with no music—just because.
And for the first time in forever—
Shin wasn’t thinking about the past.
 He wasn’t thinking about the future.
He was just living.
With her.
And it was perfect.

Chapter 296: Just Us
The city lights twinkled outside their vast bedroom window, stretching into the distance like a sea of stars.
A cool breeze drifted in through the open balcony doors, the white curtains swaying gently. The scent of the ocean carried on the wind, mingling with the faint traces of Ai’s perfume.
And in the middle of it all—
Shin and Ai.
Just the two of them.

A Night With No Distractions
Shin had no work on his mind.
 No equations. No research.
 No emails from Stanford.
Tonight was just about them.
Ai sat beside him on the plush white couch, curled up in one of his oversized shirts. She looked so effortlessly beautiful that Shin had to take a second to just… admire her.
Ai noticed.
"You're staring," she murmured, a teasing smile on her lips.
Shin smirked. "Can you blame me?"
She rolled her eyes, but the slight pink in her cheeks gave her away.

A Different Future?
As Ai took a sip of wine, she glanced at him thoughtfully.
"You know…" she began, "Dad asked about you again."
Shin raised an eyebrow. "What? Is he still trying to recruit me?"
"Obviously," she laughed. "He keeps saying a mind like yours shouldn't be 'wasted' on just research and teaching."
Shin leaned back, resting his arm behind her. "So, what? He wants me to run the company with you?"
Ai shrugged. "The option is always there. You'd be really good at it, you know."
Shin chuckled. "Maybe… but would you really want me at work with you? I’d probably slack off and spend all my time flirting with my gorgeous CEO wife."
Ai rolled her eyes, but her smile was undeniable.
“Annoying,” she muttered.
Shin grinned. “Your annoying husband.”

The Moment Slows Down
A comfortable silence settled between them.
The distant hum of the city.
 The warmth of the dim lights.
 The rhythm of their own breathing, in sync.
Shin reached out, gently tucking a strand of Ai’s hair behind her ear.
"You know," he murmured, "even if I don't join your dad’s company… I'm not going anywhere."
Ai’s eyes softened.
"I know," she whispered.
Her fingers traced over his knuckles, absentmindedly playing with his hand.
Shin pulled her closer, his forehead resting against hers.
"You’re all I need," he admitted, voice barely above a whisper.
And then, before Ai could respond—
He kissed her.
Slow. Deep. Unrushed.
Like they had all the time in the world.
Because they did.
And tonight—
Tonight was just about them.

Chapter 297: A Night to Remember
The city hummed quietly outside, but inside their home, everything had slowed down to just them.
The soft glow of the bedside lamp bathed the room in a warm, golden hue. The silky sheets rustled as Ai shifted, her deep eyes locking onto Shin’s.
A moment passed.
A moment where neither of them spoke, yet everything was understood.
Shin reached out, his fingers tracing the curve of Ai’s jaw, his touch both gentle and firm.
She leaned into him, her breath warm against his skin.
“I love you,” she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.
Shin smiled. “I know.”
Then—
He kissed her.
Slowly, deeply—no rush, no urgency. Just them. Just this moment.
And as the night stretched on—
They sealed their love in a way that left no words necessary.

Chapter 298: The Morning After
The golden rays of the morning sun peeked through the curtains, casting a soft glow over the room. The air was still, save for the rhythmic rise and fall of Ai’s breathing as she lay nestled against Shin’s bare chest.
Her hair was a tangled mess, strands sticking to her flushed cheeks. The sheets were loosely draped over them, barely covering the evidence of last night’s passionate chaos.
Shin blinked awake, his arm instinctively tightening around Ai’s waist. His muscles ached—not from exhaustion, but from overuse.
Ai stirred, her fingers absently tracing patterns on his chest. Then, slowly, she tilted her face up to meet his gaze.
“…Morning,” she whispered, her voice still hoarse from the hours they spent together.
Shin smirked, brushing a loose strand of hair from her face. “Morning. You okay?”
Ai let out a soft laugh, her cheeks heating up. “You’re asking me that?”
Shin chuckled, pressing a lazy kiss to her forehead. “I mean, I did go a little overboard.”
“A little?” Ai shot him a look before rolling onto her back with a satisfied sigh. “You weren’t this relentless in Kendo.”
Shin propped himself up on his elbow, looking down at her. “Are you complaining?”
Ai smirked. “Not at all.”
The two lay there for a moment, simply enjoying the silence. The aftermath of the night lingered in the air, but there was no rush to move.
Ai eventually stretched, wincing slightly before pulling the sheets tighter around her. “We should probably get up.”
Shin groaned. “Or… we could stay in bed all day.”
Ai rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the small smile tugging at her lips. “Tempting. But I’m starving.”
Shin sighed dramatically. “Fine. Breakfast first. But then, round two.”
Ai swatted his arm, laughing. “You’re impossible.”
He grinned, leaning down to steal another kiss. “And you love it.”

Chapter 299: The Greatest Discovery Yet
Shin was in his study, lazily scrolling through some new mathematical papers when his phone buzzed on the desk. He glanced at the caller ID—Ai.
He answered immediately, stretching his legs out on the couch. “Hey, you done with your checkup?”
There was a pause on the other end. Then, Ai’s voice came through, softer than usual. “Shin… can you come pick me up?”
Shin immediately sat up straight. “Everything okay?”
Another pause. Then Ai let out a breathless laugh. “Yeah. Just… come quickly, okay?”
Something in her voice sent a weird mix of anticipation and nervousness through his chest. He didn’t waste another second, grabbing his keys and rushing out the door.

When he arrived at the clinic, Ai was sitting in the waiting area, hands lightly clasped on her lap. She looked up as he approached, her eyes unreadable—something between excitement and disbelief.
Shin sat down beside her, heart thudding a little faster than usual. “Alright, what’s going on?”
Ai turned to him, her lips slightly quivering, before finally saying it.
“I’m pregnant.”
The words hung in the air for a moment. Shin’s brain stopped.
He blinked. Then blinked again.
“…Wait. You’re serious?”
Ai nodded, her eyes shimmering with emotion. “Yeah. I—”
She didn’t even get to finish her sentence before Shin practically tackled her into a hug.
“Holy shit—” His voice was slightly muffled in her shoulder, but Ai could hear the pure joy in it. He pulled back, hands resting on her cheeks as if trying to confirm this was real. “We’re… we’re having a baby?”
Ai laughed, nodding. “Yes, idiot.”
Shin ran a hand through his hair, his face breaking into the biggest, dumbest grin. “I—holy shit. I—” He looked around the clinic like someone needed to confirm this for him again.
Ai giggled. “That’s your reaction? ‘Holy shit’?”
Shin exhaled sharply before pulling her into another bone-crushing hug. “What the hell else am I supposed to say?! This is—this is insane.”
Ai’s hands slid up his back, holding onto him just as tightly. “I know.”
Shin finally pulled away, still grinning like an idiot. “I—oh my god, I need to call Kazama. No, wait, Hima first. No, actually, I need to sit down—wait, I am sitting down—”
Ai burst into laughter, wiping the happy tears from her eyes. “Breathe, Shin.”
Shin exhaled dramatically before looking at her again, eyes softer now. He placed a hand gently over her stomach, his fingers trembling just slightly. “You’re really… carrying our kid in there?”
Ai placed her hand over his, smiling. “Yeah.”
A heavy silence filled the space—not an awkward one, but the kind that only comes with big moments.
Then, Shin exhaled again.
“…Holy shit.”
Ai laughed, leaning into him. “Yeah. Holy shit.”
